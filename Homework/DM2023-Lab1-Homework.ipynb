You need to ask yourself some difficult questions:\\n1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain\\nit.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this\\nsalvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain\\nmodern offshoots like the \"new age movement\" teach or does he require God\\'s\\nhelp?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such\\nhelp come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for\\nsome people it did comprise their life\\'s writings, so I am hardly in a\\nposition to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few,\\nof us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).\\nThe spritual life is a difficult journey (if you\\'ve never read \"A Pilgrim\\'s\\nProgress,\" I highly recommend this greatest allegory of the english language).\\n\\n>Peace and Love\\n>In God(ess)\\'s name\\n>James Moss\\n\\nNow I see by your close that one possible source of trouble for you may be a\\nconflict between your politcal beliefs and your religious upbringing.  You\\nwrote that \"I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most\\nof the teachings of christ\".  Well, Christ referred to God as \"My Father\",\\nnot \"My Mother\", and while the \"maleness\" of God is not the same as the\\nmaleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not\\nhonor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory,\\nor politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent\\nto do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - \\nenglish just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God\\nchose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human\\npopulation.\\n\\nWell, I\\'m not about to launch into a detailed discussion of\\nthe role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the\\nlast 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this\\narticle.

At this time her doctor \\n suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue.\\n\\n While attending one of her therapy sessions, while her arm was being \\n manipulated, some damage occured (nerve?) which caused the level of pain to permanently\\n increase severly (controlled by Tylenol 3s) and some loss of use of the arm (\\n palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement). With great persistence on her part\\n the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had\\n been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm. This was removed also but the\\n pain in the arm has not decreased. The doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is \\n persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed Tylenol 3\\n and soon Morphine to relieve the pain.

He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself\\nas some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what\\nhe considered himself to be -- \"a great coward.\" \\n\\nOFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be\\nembarrassed by Lewis\\' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is\\npart of a *much* bigger discourse.)

Using alternating currents of high frequency to \\'illuminate\\'\\n  their subjects, they photographed them.  They found that if an object\\n  was a good conductor (such as a metal) the picture showed only its\\n  surface, while the pictures of poor conductors showed the inner\\n  structure of the object even if it were optically opaque.  They found\\n  too that these high frequency pictures could distinguish between dead\\n  and living objects.  Dead ones had a constant outline whilst living ones\\n  were subject to changes.  The object\\'s life activity was also visible in\\n  highly variable colour patterns.\\n\\n  High frequency photography has now been practised for twenty years in\\n  the Soviet Union but only a few people in the West have taken it up\\n  seriously.  Professor Douglas Dean in New York and Professor Philips at\\n  Washington University in St Louis have produced Kirlian photographs and\\n  others have been produced in Brazil, Austria and Germany.\\n\\n  Using Kirlian photography it is possible to show an aura around people\\'s\\n  fingers, notably around those of healers who are concentrating on\\n  healing someone.  Normally, blue and white rays emanate from the fingers\\n  but, when a subject becomes angry or excited, the aura turns red and\\n  spotty.  The Soviets are now using Kirlian photography to diagnose\\n  diseases which cannot be diagnosed by any other method.  They argue that\\n  in most illnesses there is a preclinical stage during which the person\\n  isn\\'t actually ill but is about to be.  They claim to be able to\\n  foretell a disease by photographing its preclinical phase.\\n\\n  But the most exciting phenomenon illustrated by Kirlian photography is\\n  the phantom effect.  During high frequency photography of a leaf from\\n  which a part had been cut, the photograph gave a complete picture of the\\n  leaf with the removed part showing up faintly.  This is extremely\\n  important because it backs up the experiences of psychics who can \\'see\\'\\n  the legs of amputees as if they were still there.  The important thing\\n  about the Kirlian phantoms though is that the electromagnetic pattern\\n  can\\'t possibly represent a secondary phenomenon -- or the field would\\n  vanish when the piece of leaf or leg vanished.  The energy grid\\n  contained in a living object must therefore be far more significant than\\n  the actual object itself.\\n\\n  [...]\\n\\n  Kirlian photography has shown how water mentally \\'charged\\' by a healer\\n  has a much richer energy field around it than ordinary water...\\n\\n\\nFrom the incredulous side: [MacRobert, Alan, \"Reality shopping; a\\nconsumer\\'s guide to new age hokum.\", _Whole Earth Review_, Autumn 1986,\\nvNON4 p4(11).

Many paranormal\\n  movements can be traced back to such people -- Kirlian photography, for\\n  instance.  If you pump high-voltage electricity into anything it will\\n  emit glowing sparks, common knowledge to electrical workers and\\n  hobbyists for a century.

I feel as though\\nI want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof -\\njust as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't\\ndefinitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by\\nreligious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to\\nunderstand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.\\n\\n        Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is\\ncorrect?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian\\nGod exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about\\npeople who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me -\\nagnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their\\nbeliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between\\nthe religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do\\nyou have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow\\na different religion than you would if they were Christian??\\n\\n        Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in\\nthe bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be\\nstories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??\\n\\n        I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are\\nfairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and\\n'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find\\nhard is the actual belief in God.\\n\\n        Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite\\nbelieve in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not\\nbelieving doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why\\nI so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.\\n\\n        Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came\\ninto my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.\\n\\n                        Thanks for the help,\\n                                Paul Simmons\\n\\n[There's been enough discussion about evidence for Christianity\\nrecently that you may prefer to respond to this via email rather than\\nas a posting.  --clh]\\n\",\n",

On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed\\na transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they\\nwere generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation\\nbetween the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness\\nfrom reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan\\'s\\nmodel showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model \\nin sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to\\nour boy\\'s model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in\\nthe winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer.\\nHe predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry,\\nthe biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would\\nprobably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even\\nless than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.\\n\\nTo quote from H.S. Yoder,\\n\\n\\tThe postulated models have become accepted as the reality\\n\\tinstead of the lattice of assumptions they are.\\n\\tAuthoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical\\n\\tanalysis of each argument is to be encouraged....

The message of \"praying in Jesus\\' name\" is thus closely\\naligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God\\'s\\ndelegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and\\nresponsibilities.

The OAM is a small division of \\nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \\nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \\nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \\navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \\nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \\nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \\neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \\nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \\nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \\nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \\ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists\\' \\ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \\nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \\npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \\nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \\nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \\nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \\nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It\\'s only fair to give the \\nOffice time to gel, but  it\\'s up to the public to insist that it\\'s much, much \\nmore [than  public relations].\" \\n======================================================================   \\n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \\nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \\n\\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\\n6 can attack the human immune system\\'s natural killer cells.

Scientists previously knew that the natural \\nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso\\'s  \\nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \\nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \\nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \\nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \\nbody.  Lusso\\'s  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \\nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \\nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV\\'s attack.   Researchers concluded that \\nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \\n\\n    ======================================================================   \\n                                April 15, 1993 \\n     ====================================================================   \\n\\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \\nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \\nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \\n\\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \\nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \\nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \\nand Dale F.

Dr. Berkley\\'s editorial on why American doctors  should care \\nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \\nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \\nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \\nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \\nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \\ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \\nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \\non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \\nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \\naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \\nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \\nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \\nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \\nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \\ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \\nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \\ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \\nchange the future of worldwide health. \\n====================================================================   \\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \\n\\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \\nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \\nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \\nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \\nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \\nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \\neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \\nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \\nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \\ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \\ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \\nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \\nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \\nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \\nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \\nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \\nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \\neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \\nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \\nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \\nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \\nhas been the rule.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\\n\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\\n\\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n     ********************************************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n                                March 29, 1993\\n\\n\\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\\n\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \\nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \\nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \\n\\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \\nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \\n\\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \\nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \\nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \\n\\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \\nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \\nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \\ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \\nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \\ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \\nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \\nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \\n\\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.

It will be several years, however, before researchers \\nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \\n\\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \\nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \\ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \\nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID\\'s division of AIDS.  \"We need this \\ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \\nHIV infection in children.\" \\n\\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \\nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \\n\\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \\npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \\na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \\nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \\ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \\nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \\n\\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \\nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \\ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \\ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \\nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \\nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \\n\\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \\nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \\nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \\nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \\nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \\n\\nStudy chair John S.

Although the \\nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals\\' \\nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \\nitself caused the skin disease. \\n\\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \\nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \\nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \\ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \\nRetroviruses. \\n\\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \\nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \\nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \\nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \\n\\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \\neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \\ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \\n\\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \\ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \\nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \\nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \\n\\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \\nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \\nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \\nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \\n\\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \\ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \\ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \\nanimals. \\n\\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \\npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \\non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \\n\\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \\nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \\ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals\\' immune \\nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \\nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \\n\\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \\nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \\ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \\nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \\ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \\nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \\n\\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \\nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \\nDiseases. \\n\\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \\nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \\nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \\nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\\n                                H H S   N E W S\\n                 ********************************************\\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\\n\\n                                 March 4, 1993\\n\\n\\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \\nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \\nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \\ninfection or AIDS. \\n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \\nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \\ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \\nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \\nSan Francisco General Hospital. \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \\nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \\ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \\ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \\ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \\nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \\n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \\nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \\ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \\n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \\nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \\nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \\nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \\nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \\nanswered as quickly as possible. \\n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \\nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \\ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \\nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \\ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \\nsources of information or materials. \\n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \\nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \\npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \\ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \\nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \\nmedications, sex, age and the patient\\'s HIV history. \\n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \\nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA\\'s Bureau of Health \\nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \\nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \\n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \\ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \\nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \\nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \\n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \\nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA\\'s associate \\nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \\nDevelopment, G. Stephen Bowen, M.D., M.P.H.  \"Providers who treat people with \\nHIV or AIDS have access to the latest information on new drugs, treatment \\nmethods and therapies for people with HIV or AIDS.\" \\n     HRSA is one of eight U.S. Public Health Service agencies within HHS.  \\n\\n\\n                      AIDS Hotline Numbers for Consumers\\n\\n                  CDC National AIDS Hotline -- 1-800-342-AIDS\\n                  for information in Spanish - 1-800-344-SIDA\\n          AIDS Clinical Trials (English & Spanish) -- 1-800-TRIALS-A\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 53\\n\\x0c\\n------------- cut here -----------------\\n-- This is the last part ---------------\\n\\n---\\n      Internet: david@stat.com                  FAX: +1 (602) 451-1165\\n      Bitnet: ATW1H@ASUACAD                     FidoNet=> 1:114/15\\n                Amateur Packet ax25: wb7tpy@wb7tpy.az.usa.na\\n',\n",

So\\nthere\\'s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a\\ngiven context.  Insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely\\nand makes progress impossible.  (Expenditure of sufficiently large sums\\nof money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this.)  On the other\\nhand, with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which\\neventually turn out to be false.  There is a morass of studies\\ncontradicting other studies and outsiders start saying  \"You people call\\nTHIS science?\"   (My opinion, for what it\\'s worth, is that one sees both\\nthese phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology.)  \\n\\nSome subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor\\nappropriate for a particular investigation.  I don\\'t believe it is \\never possible to banish subjective judgement from science.  \\n\\n\\nMy second point, though, is that highly capable people can often make\\nextremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using\\nmethodology considered inadequate by the usual standards.  I think this\\nis true of many scientists and I think it is true of many who approach\\ntheir discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific.\\n\\nWithin mathematics, I think there are several examples, especially before\\nthe twentieth century.  One conspicuous case is that of Riemann, who is\\nfamous for many theorems he stated but did not prove.  (Later \\nmathematicians did prove them, of course.)  \\n\\nI think that for a good scientist, empirical investigation is often not\\nso much a matter of determining what is true and what\\'s not  as it is a \\nmatter of convincing other people.  (People have proposed lots of \\nincompatible definitions of science here, but I think the ability to \\nobjectively convince others of the validity of one\\'s results is an\\nessential element.  Not that one can necessarily do that at every step \\nof the scientific process, but I think that if one is not moving toward \\nthat goal then one is not doing science.)\\n\\nWhen a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and\\nseems to be very successful at it, I think that his judgements are also\\nworthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further\\ninvestigation.  \\n\\nIn article <C53By5.HD@news.Hawaii.Edu> I wrote: \\n> Namely, is there really justification for the belief that\\n> science is a superior path to truth than non-scientific approaches?  \\n\\nAdmittedly, my question was not at all well posed.  A considerable\\namount of effort in a \"serious scholarly investigation\" such as I\\nsuggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately \\nspecific question to try and answer.  \\n\\nThe \"science\" I was thinking of in my question is the actual science \\ncurrently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century.  \\nI certainly wasn\\'t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use \\nof \"reason and observation.\"\\n\\nOne thing I had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether\\nin many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced\\npractitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies.  \\n\\nSince Russell Turpin seems to be much more familiar than I am with\\nthe study of scientific methodology, perhaps he can tell us if there \\nis any existing research related to this question.  \\n\\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

Overacker writes, responding to Simon:\\n\\n   I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the\\n   net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in\\n   schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that\\'s really beside\\n   the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say?\\n   Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as\\n   provided for in canon law.\\n\\nHere\\'s some of the theology involved for the interested.\\n\\nThere is confusion over this issue of the SSPX\\'s \"schism\"; often the\\nbasic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:\\n\\n- true obedience\\n- false obedience\\n- disobedience\\n- schism\\n\\nTake the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2\\nimportant elements involved here for my purposes:\\n\\n1) a command\\n2) the response made to the command\\n\\nAs far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the\\nPope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be\\nILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon when every other full moon comes around.\\n\\nAs far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do\\nwhat is commanded, or to COMPLY.\\n\\nMaking a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:\\n\\ncommand         response            name\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\nLEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience\\nLEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience\\nILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience\\n\\nSo now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.\\n\\nObedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of\\nthe commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to\\nconsider someone\\'s compliance or refusal and then say whether they are\\n\"obedient\" or \"disobedient\".  You also have to take into consideration\\nwhether the commands are good or bad.\\n\\nIn my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god\\nDagon, and they all refuse, they aren\\'t being disobedient at all!\\n\\nAs far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly\\nrefusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that\\nalone is insufficient to allow one to label them \"disobedient\".  You\\nalso have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been\\ncommanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of\\ncourse disagreed.\\n\\nSo where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak\\nPopes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only\\nway to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the\\ntraditional teaching of the Church is.\\n\\nThe problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of\\nwhat is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of\\nAmerican Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You\\nwill never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press\\nin this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I\\nget -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the\\nSociety of Saint Pius X.)\\n\\nMany Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some\\nsoundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually\\nsome Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand,\\nthere is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the\\nPopes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to\\nhelp the situation by obeying them where they\\'re wrong.  In fact, if\\nthe situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very\\nleast, they\\'re wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing\\nto love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this\\nbadly.\\n\\nSchism... let\\'s move on to schism.  What is it?\\n\\nSchism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate\\ncommand).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it\\'s a superset, so\\nit doesn\\'t work the other way around: not all disobeyers are\\nschismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don\\'t comply with\\nthe Holy Father\\'s desires doesn\\'t make them schismatics.\\n\\nSo what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a\\nschism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.\\n\\nYou must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any\\ndecent reference on Catholic theology, and that\\'s what you\\'ll find:\\nthe distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to\\ncommand.\\n\\nHere\\'s what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:\\n\\n    ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this\\n    character it must include besides the trangression of the commands\\n    of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command.\\n    (from the CE article \"Schism\")\\n\\nIs the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear\\nno: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every\\nday.  And that\\'s all that matters as far as schism goes.\\n\\nWhat all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the\\nconsideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position\\nis a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and\\nschism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they\\nthink that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of\\nthe Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone\\nwho finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)\\n\\nNow, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the\\nHoly Father\\'s motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", you can find out.  It\\'s the\\ndefinitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically\\nPapal act.  It\\'s not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter\\nthat the Pope has possibly never even read.  It\\'s from the Pope\\nhimself.  His boss is God... there\\'s no one else to complain to.\\n\\nIn this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:\\n\\n1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre\\nconstituted a schismatic act.\\n\\n2) Archbishop Lefebvre\\'s problem was a misunderstanding of the nature\\nof Tradtion.\\n\\nBoth are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope\\'s points.\\n\\nAs far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting\\narticle in a translation of the Italian magazine \"Si Si No No\".  It\\nall gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal\\nconsecrations imply rejection of the Pope\\'s jurisdiction, then they\\nwould truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication\\nunder the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is\\nthis: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal\\nconsecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power\\nof Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be\\nconferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the\\nPope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite\\nwell, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over\\nanyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.\\n\\nThe \"Si Si No No\" article was interesting in that it posited that the\\nreason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel,\\npost-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea,\\nepiscopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article\\nto a friend, unfortunately, so can\\'t tell you more.  I believe they\\nquoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.\\n\\nThe Pope\\'s thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me.\\nThere\\'s no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic\\ntheology.  So why does the Pope think this?\\n\\nAs far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here\\'s\\nthe passage in question:\\n\\n    The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete\\n    and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does\\n    not take sufficiently into the account the living character of\\n    Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,\\n\\n        comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the\\n        help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into\\n        the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes\\n        about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and\\n        study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts.\\n        It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which\\n        they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who\\n        have received, along with their right of succession in the\\n        espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.\\n\\n    But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which\\n    opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the\\n    Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to\\n    remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond\\n    with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ\\n    himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.\\n\\n    (Papal motu proprio \"Ecclesia Dei\", 2 July 1988)\\n\\nIt seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can\\nbe simplified to the following:\\n\\n- Vatican Council II has happened.\\n- I am the Pope.\\n\\nThe argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that\\nArchbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them.\\nThis is weak, to say the least!\\n\\nIt would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed\\nArchbishop Lefebvre\\'s concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II\\'s\\nstand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius\\nIX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to\\nignore what all these Popes said on the subject?\\n\\nI don\\'t know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the\\nSSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n[Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey\\n\"justified disobedience\" or even \"obeying God rather than man\".\\nCalling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in\\nWonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.\\n\\nSimilarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope\\nsays that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it\\nexists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break,\\nthat there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will\\nshortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?\\n\\nIt seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing\\nyou are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it\\ndo you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in\\nthe process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church\\ndiscipline?  It\\'s one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his\\npowers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It\\'s something else to\\nsay that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is\\nall in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are\\nnot legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally\\nit has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope.\\nWhile they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they\\nhave admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door\\nto people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly\\nobeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated.\\nThis would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command\\nthat you say defines schism.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

There\\nwas no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else\\nwas laid out exactly as it had been left.

Bede is a great\\nscholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived\\n673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of\\nthe word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well\\nestablished before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth\\nof anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely\\nthat his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that\\nthere had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name,\\nand the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance\\n(surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should\\nhave a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf\\nconvincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does\\nnot make it more so.\\n\\nAssuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the\\nChristian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some\\ncenturies before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots.\\nIt would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians\\nand beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every\\nspring, called it by the name that to them meant simply \"Spring\\nFestival.\"\\n\\nHowever, Bede\\'s is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J\\nKnoblech, in \"Die Sprach,\" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5\\n(Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:\\n\\nAmong Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast\\nof the Resurrection was known as \"hebdomada alba\" (white week),\\nsince the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their\\nwhite baptismal robes throughout that week.

I would prefer a method that would do this in as little\\n>  time as possible.  I need this for use in a forward raytracing\\n>  program.\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

THIS VERSION\\nNOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for\\nC programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free \\nto contact me.\\nThe other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from\\nthe FPU version to make it run faster.\\n\\nThose of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.\\n\\n********\\n\\nProgrammers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nDidn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of \\ndrawing three-dimensional scenes? \\n\\nDidn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure \\nof three-dimensional molecules?\\n\\nAnd didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from \\nactually doing it?\\n\\nWell if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to \\ndo with this package???' , read on.\\n\\nGrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines \\nfor building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating \\n(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) \\nthree dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.\\n\\nGrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-\\nline/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.\\n\\nGrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel\\nprojections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing\\noff for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain\\nwhat it all means later on). \\n\\nGrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with\\ndata so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines\\nto do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so\\nyou don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)\\n\\nGrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above \\nprocessors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.\\nBoth versions are *100% source compatibel*. \\n\\nGrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D\\ngraphics and how to use the package.\\n\\nIf demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. \\nHowever, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for\\na lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.\\n\\nGrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.\\n\\n\\nEnjoy,\\nChristian Franz\\n\",\n",

It\\'s a very biblical doctrine as\\nRomans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church\\nhas always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say\\nthat I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free\\nwill.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also\\naffected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and\\nJansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with\\nthe idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). \\nFor God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect,\\nwho he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final\\nperserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those\\nwithout that grace can\\'t be saved, it just means that god foreknew their\\nobstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need\\nit, as they had freely chosen hell.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t  ^^^^^^^^^^^\\nPeople who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own\\neffort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined\\nthem to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish\\nbecause they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were\\ndeserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and\\nsinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.\\n\\n>yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that\\n>punishment at the last judgement. \\n\\nWell, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some\\nblessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little),\\nfor those He can\\'t bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And\\nthose He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one\\nor in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal\\npunishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it\\n(cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David\\'s sin of Adultery and Murder were\\nforgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I\\nneed not point out the idea of punishment because of God\\'s judgement is\\nquite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from\\nthe Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira,\\nJerusalem in 70 AD, etc.\\n\\n> if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is\\nnot a >good parallel, but i\\'m going to go with it anyway), why should we\\nnot >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more\\n>innocent?\\n\\nWe should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but\\ndoes that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the\\nU.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an\\nisolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in\\nthe case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily\\ninvolved, it would not be a \"just war.\"  \"Blessed\" after all, \"are the\\npeacemakers\" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.

Second, the historical\\nrecord suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as\\nextreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history)\\nclaimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing\\n(I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean,\\nin the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son \"uncreate\" -- surely even \\nArians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius\\'s\\nopponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed\\nthat she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require\\ntwo seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because\\nMary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely,\\nif you accept \"Nestorianism\" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined,\\na la Chalcedon.\\n\\nSecond, I am not sure that \"Nestorianism\" is not a better alternative than\\nthe orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation\\nthat Jesus\\'s human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think\\nrather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate\\nnature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine\\nnature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature\\nprevailed.\\n\\nComments on the above warmly appreciated.\\n\\nJason Albert\\n\\n[There may be differences in what we mean by \"subject to sin\".  The\\noriginal complaint was from someone who didn\\'t see how we could call\\nJesus fully human, because he didn\\'t sin.  I completely agree that\\nJesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by\\nnot succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do\\nnot have to sin in order to be human.\\n\\nI again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I\\nagree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there\\'s reason to think\\nthat not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in\\nfact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was\\nnot Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of\\nthe correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he\\ngot the better of them.\\n\\nHowever, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to\\nChalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least\\n\"rash and dogmatic\" (as the editor of \"The Christological Controversy\"\\nrefers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As\\nregular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an\\nimpediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I\\nthink are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from\\nCyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says \"To attribute also\\nto [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics\\nof the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother,\\neither the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the\\nGreeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and\\nApollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the\\nidea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine\\nLogos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some\\ndegree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his\\nfearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off\\non the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us\\nwho perpetrate the falsehood.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between\\nhumanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based\\non exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have \"to some\\ndegree\" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it\\nmust be understood that there\\'s a certain indirectness in the Logos\\'\\nparticipation in these things.  But there must be some sort of\\nidentification between the divine and human, or we don\\'t have an\\nincarnation at all.

Buehler)\\nSubject: Re: SSPX schism ?\\nOrganization: none\\nLines: 182\\n\\nHere is some material by Michael Davies on the subject of schism in\\ngeneral and Archishop Lefebvre in particular.  He wrote it around\\n1990.  The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous\\nactivities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all\\nthat.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.\\n\\nJoe Buehler\\n\\n...\\n\\nSchism and Disobedience\\n\\nAccording to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a\\nrefusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the\\nChurch united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever\\nthe subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he\\nmust be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to\\nthe Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of\\njurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it\\nclear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of\\ndisobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the\\nbeginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American\\nbishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.\\n\\nThe distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in\\nthe article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de\\nTheologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is\\ncertainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism\\nand disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father\\nCongar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence\\nof legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther\\'s rejection\\nof the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a\\ndecision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not\\nconstitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia\\nexplains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to\\nintend \"to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.\"  It\\nadds that \"not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this\\ncharacter it must include besides the transgression of the command of\\nthe superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.\"Not only\\ndoes Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command,\\nbut he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope\\'s authority and\\nhis intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made\\nhis attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: \"We pray\\nfor the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations\\nlast June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II\\nthe legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don\\'t even say that he\\nis a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor\\nheresy.\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nIntrinsically Schismatic?\\n\\nThe principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in\\nschism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is\\nan intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a\\nconsecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is\\nnot true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it\\nwould always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917\\nCode of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see\\nCanon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to\\nexcommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic\\nchurch in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops\\ndiffered radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre\\nas the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope,\\nthat is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the\\nillicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise\\nan apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the\\nbishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of\\njurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of\\nensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and\\nalso to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way\\nthe gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of\\nbishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the\\nordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the\\nprimacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman\\nPontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the\\nChurch could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in\\nresponse.\\n\\nIt appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop\\'s critics\\nthat he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican\\nhas certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not\\nso much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of\\nCanon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled\\n\"Penalties for Specific Offenses\" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The\\nfirst part deals with \"Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the\\nChurch\" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon\\n1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together\\nwith apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses\\nagainst the unity of the Church.\\n\\nBut the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this\\ncanon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against\\nreligion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his\\nexcommunication comes from the third section of \"Penalties for\\nSpecific Offenses\" which is entitled \"Usurpation of Ecclesial\\nFunctions and Offenses in their Exercise\" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum\\nUsurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is\\nCanon 1382, which reads: \"A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and\\nthe person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a\\npontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae)\\nexcommunication reserved to the Holy See.\"\\n\\nThe scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense\\nof schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable\\nsmear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly\\njustify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate\\nparallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had\\nbeen convicted of first degree murder.\\n\\nI must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion\\nof laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers\\nwithout the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated\\nthe charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father\\nPatrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut\\nCatholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs\\nactuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not\\nexcommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical\\nfunction. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which\\nconstitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the\\nillicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of\\nthe sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a\\nparallel Church.\\n\\nCardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the\\nAuthentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations\\nin the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to\\nimagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:\\n\\n    The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not\\n    in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with\\n    offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses\\n    against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are\\n    apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a\\n    pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the\\n    exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the\\n    consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh\\n    Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated\\n    he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because\\n    there was no intention of a breach with the Church.\\n\\n....\\n\\nIt is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating\\nbishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least\\nintent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and\\nwill never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that\\nthe the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy,\\nand that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to\\nconsecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon\\nLaw provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that\\nthe future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these\\nconsecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it\\ncould not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred\\nexcommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates\\nas Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot\\nexpect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a\\ngreat and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to\\nthe service of the Church and the salvation of souls.\\n\\nDr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce\\nAssociation, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he\\nknows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no\\ngreater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and\\nthe Holy See during the Archbishop\\'s lifetime. A quotation from a\\nstatement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February\\n1989 Remnant merits careful study:\\n\\n    In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June\\n    appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also\\n    papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist \"obstinancies.\" And from the\\n    eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to\\n    present the Archbishop\\'s act of grave disobedience as an offense\\n    against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has \"an\\n    erroneous concept of Tradition.\" If this were so, Cardinal\\n    Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the\\n    Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987:\\n    \"Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it\\n    \\'the means to live and prosper\\' testifies to your attachment to\\n    the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern\\n    and shares it.\"\\n',\n",

I\\'m not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\\nin advance)\\n\\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\\nis this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:\\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It\\'s been alleged that a few\\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\\nI\\'m afraid.)\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian\\nlanguage as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things\\nlike \"one essense and three persons\".  Obviously the three-fold\\nbaptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the\\nterm \"three-fold\" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly\\nconsistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose\\nfull formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent\\'s.  It\\'s unlikely\\nthat Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine.\\nIndeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do\\nnot believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae\\noccurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in\\nthe name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as\\nwell.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we\\'re commanded in Mat.\\nto baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,\\nand in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.\\n\\n\"Jesus only\" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this\\nconsistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of\\nthe Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I\\'m not the right one to\\nask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not\\nappear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of\\ndealing with the idiomatic phrase \"in the name of\".)\\n\\nThose who use the three-fold formula don\\'t seem to have a standard\\nanswer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus.\\nI suspect that the most common explanation is to say that \"in the name\\nof\" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name\\nof Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus\\'\\nauthority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism\\nwith the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there\\'s a\\ncertain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we\\ncould just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn\\'t require the specific\\nthree-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes\\nbaptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\n\\nOne might well suspect that in the early church, more than one\\nbaptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to\\nbe the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great\\ndamage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that\\nI think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of\\nthe few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize\\nmutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in\\nthe interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that\\nthose groups that actually use \"in the name of Jesus\" now do seem to\\nhave in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I\\'ve said before, I\\'m\\nnot the one to explain what their doctrine is.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

Another kind of\\ncriticism is that the work, while technically correct, is either\\nnot important or not interesting.  The first difference is the\\none that I have been pointing to.

Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs!

The Bible \"ends\"\\nwith the book of Revelations. But does God\\'s reign end there ? No.\\nSo who can say for sure that God\\'s messages are either no longer\\nhappening or still happening ?\\n\\nI can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-)\\nWith the cold response I\\'ve gotten from the past from this\\ngroup, it\\'s very hard to get the point across. I\\'ll only\\ngo over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look\\nat documents stored somewhere. I\\'ve cited the uncorrupted\\nbodies of saints before. They\\'re still there. 8-)\\nThe apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle\\nspecifically granted to show God\\'s existence. That was\\nthe spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several\\ncountries. That event is \"approved\" by the Pope. Currently,\\nimages of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa\\nare showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under\\ninvestigation by the Church. But realize that investigations\\ntake decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come\\nin ten days, that\\'s a bit too late, isn\\'t it 8-).\\nOther events under investigation are inner locutions (\"coming\\nto know\"), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ\\'s wounds. And\\nthey don\\'t heal. And doctor\\'s don\\'t know why).\\nNon-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I\\'m sure.\\n\\nThis stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M\\nor God will call me home). It\\'s free. Find out why they\\'re\\nhappening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody\\ncan figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion.\\nIf you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned.\\nThese are not \"members only\" events. God and Mary invites \\neverybody.\\n\\nSo in conclusion (finally) ...\\nWe RC\\'s believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary.\\nWe are scared to death sometimes although we\\'re told not to.\\nThere are more proofs and events.

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.\\n\\nBill\\n',\n",

I called it \"Easy reading.\"  The reason I\\ndropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical\\nSimon\\'s.  I don\\'t know how many walking encyclopedia\\'s I ran across in\\nphilosphy classes.  The problem isn\\'t in knowing sooooo much more than your\\naverage lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. \\nSchaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was\\nwritting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was\\nto simple.  I\\'ve talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I\\'ve been in lectures with\\nthe man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof\\'s from secular\\nas well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) \\nHis answers were enough that the prof\\'s themselves often were taken back and\\ncaused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at\\ndifferent open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well,\\nsimplistic.  It certainly isn\\'t grad level reading.  But we must get off our\\nhigh horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most\\npeople would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to\\nsay about this secular scientist at another time.\\n\\nAlso, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent*\\ninquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt\\nbase.  \\n\\nLook, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must\\nadd a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in\\nkeeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know\\nits limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust\\nit of all value!\\n\\nTHis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic.\\n It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian\\nfaith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we\\nfly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic\\nlesson of life: \\n\\n\"More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.\"  \\n\\nOr as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o\\nfreedom.\\n\\nLet\\'s put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to\\nabsurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the\\ndifference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity\\'s contention with\\nrationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very\\nlittle else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust\\ngo hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called\\nto go on by itself without his understanding.\\n\\nThis is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the\\nChristian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment\\nand say, \"Father I do not understand you but I trust you.\"  Now don\\'t read all\\nyour objections of me into that statement.  I wasn\\'t saying I do not understand\\nyou at all, but I trust you anyway.\" It means that \"I do not understand You *in\\nthis situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway\"  Therefore I can\\ntrust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery\\nunrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is\\na statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of\\nFaith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is\\nnot a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know\\nwhy, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nNow, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted\\ncompany with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit\\nmore difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith\\nlike the insistent \"whying\" of a 3 year old.  It isn\\'t just that we would like\\nto know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot\\nknow.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other\\nleads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in\\ncoming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after\\ncoming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need\\nto know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp\\nthat, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may\\ncount decisevely against what we are able to trust.  \\n\\nIf, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust\\nhim in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian\\nleaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which\\nallows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be\\nambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to\\nus, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity.\\nAnd that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in\\npractice.   \\n\\n--Rex\\n',\n",

The founder of this\\nsect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the\\nPromised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major\\nreligions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin-\\nduism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of\\nJesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised\\nMessiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all\\nthe great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger\\nfrom God have been fulfilled.\\n\\n        The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and\\nextreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris-\\ntians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit-\\nnessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect\\nis being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes.\\nDispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many\\nadherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who\\ncome from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.\\n\\n        The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about\\na better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli-\\ngions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth-\\nerhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi\\nMuslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe-\\ncially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.\\n\\n        Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es-\\ntablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin-\\nics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed\\nby  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect\\'s\\ninternal resources.\\n\\n        The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral\\nreform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under\\none universal religion.\\n\\n\\nNEWSGROUP CREATION: \\n==================\\n\\n        When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will\\nofficially  end.

At the same time, we are faced with\\nWitt\\'s own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes\\nin our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more\\nperspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it\\nis already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to\\noffer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his\\nTractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse\\nof the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. \\nPerfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about\\nour buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.\\n\\n  This is why John\\'s Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in\\nit conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of\\nunderstanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of \"as a man thinketh, so\\nhe is.\"  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside,\\nthat is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals\\nof truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that\\nthere is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too\\nare knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the\\nindividual.  There is, and we shouldn\\'t shy from this, a mysticism to\\nChristianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the\\none who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the\\nSpirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has\\nthe capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not\\nonly has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things\\nof God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep\\nthings of GOd that are absolute and true.\\n   There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced\\nand it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because\\nif it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  \\n\\n\"I would know the words which He would answer me, and understand what He would\\nsay unto me.\"  Job 23ff\\n\\n--Rex\\n\\nsuggested, easy reading about epistimology:  \"He is there and He is not Silent\"\\n by Francis Schaeffer.\\n',\n",

And most especially to be aware of the\\n*questions* NLP suggests which might be worthy of scientific\\ninvestigation.\\n\\nOver and over again the response I get in sci.pychology is  \"If this\\nhasn\\'t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical\\nresearch then it can\\'t be of any interest to us.\"  \\n\\nTo me, the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme \"There\\'ve got to\\nbe controlled studies\" position is an NLP technique called the Fast\\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.\\n\\nSimple phobias (as opposed to agoraphobia) may not be the world\\'s most \\nimportant psychological disorder, but the nice thing about them is that \\nit doesn\\'t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell \\nwhen someone is cured of one.  The NLP phobia cure is a simple \\nvisualization which requires less than 15 minutes.  (NLPers claim that\\nit can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory, and hence is\\nuseful in treating Post-traumatic Stress Syndrome.)  It is essentially\\na variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral\\ntherapists.  A subject only needs to be taken through the technique once\\n(or, in the case of PTSD, once for each traumatic incident).  The\\nprocess doesn\\'t need to be repeated and the subject doesn\\'t need to\\npractice it over again at home.\\n\\nNow to me, it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure. \\n(Especially if, as NLPers claim, the success rate is extremely high.)  \\nTake someone with a fear of heights (as I used to have).  Take them up \\nto a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response.  Spend 15 \\nminutes to have them do the simple visualization.  Send them back up to \\nthe balcony and see if things have changed.  Check back with them in a \\nfew weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting.  (More long term \\nfollow-up is certainly desirable, but from a scientific point of view \\neven a cure that lasts several weeks has significance.  In any case, \\nthere are many known cases where the cure has lasted years.  To the best \\nof my knowledge, there is no known case where the cure has been reversed \\nafter holding for a few weeks.)  (My own cure, incidentally, was done\\nwith a slightly different NLP technique, before I learned of the Fast \\nPhobia/Trauma Cure.  Ten years later now, I enjoy living on the 17th\\nfloor of my building and having a large balcony.)  \\n\\nThe folks over in sci.psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to\\nmake this simple test.  They claim that only an elaborate outcome study\\nwill be satisfactory --- a study of the sort that NLP practitioners, \\nmany of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice, can ill \\nafford to do.  (Most of them are also just plain not interested, because \\nthe whole idea seems frivolous.  And since they\\'re not part of the\\nscientific establishment, they have no tangible rewards to gain \\nfrom scientific acceptance.) \\n\\nThe Fast Phobia/Trauma Cure is over ten years old now and the clinical \\npsychology establishment is still saying \"We don\\'t have any way of \\nknowing that it\\'s effective.\"  \\n\\nThese academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate \\nas anyone could want, of course, but they say  \"Why should I prove your \\ntheory?\"  and  \"The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.\"  \\nOne academic in sci.psychology said that it would be completely \\nunscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn\\'t \\nbeen described in a scientific journal.  (It\\'s described in a number of \\nbooks and I\\'ve posted articles in sci.psychology describing it in as much \\ndetail as I\\'m capable of.)  \\n\\nActually, at least one fairly careful academic study has been done (with \\nfavorable results), but it\\'s apparently not acceptable because it\\'s a\\ndoctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal.\\n\\nTo me, this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it.  \\nThis is the kind of thing I have in mind when I talk about \"doctrinnaire\" \\nattitudes about science.  \\n\\nNow maybe I have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you, Russell.  \\nIf so, I apologize. \\n \\n--\\nIn the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists, psychology seems \\nless like a science than a collection of competing religious sects.   \\n\\nlady@uhunix.uhcc.hawaii.edu         lady@uhunix.bitnet\\n',\n",

I got it from\\na The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the\\neditor.\\n\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\\n\\n    The Patron of Youth\\n\\n\\n    The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince\\n    Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured\\n    soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of\\n    Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and\\n    honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in\\n    the manner expected.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius\\' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from\\n    praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the\\n    life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this\\n    life.  As  Saint  Aloysius\\tgrew, he began to resemble his mother\\n    more than his father.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father\\'s\\n    soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he\\n    fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an\\n    example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).\\n\\n    About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received\\n    from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself\\n    became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and\\n    asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.\\n\\n    He wanted to share Our Lord\\'s suffering to\\tshow  his  reciprocal\\n    love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the\\n    finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of\\n    wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God.\\n    While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his\\n    younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11.\\n    Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well\\n    with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite,\\n    intelligent and always had something interesting to say.\\n\\n\\n    Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint\\tIgna-\\n    tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits)\\n    towards which Saint Aloysius\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  -12-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the\\n    marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.\\n\\n    After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in\\n    order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even\\n\\n    through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the\\n    religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.\\n\\n    The Marquis\\' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his\\n    son:  \"Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish-\\n    ness?\" \"I will not, father,\" was the  in-evitable  reply.\\t\"Then\\n    leave from my sight and don\\'t return until you change your mind!\"\\n    With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to\\tpray:\\n    \"Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!\" He knelt down\\n    to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but\\n    this  time\\the was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This\\n    at last brought the proud man to his senses. \"The Lord wants him,\\n    the Lord can have him.\" He gave his consent for his son to become\\n    a Jesuit.\\n\\n    After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri-\\n    ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and\\n    could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy-\\n    sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare\\n    the dying for a holy death.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from\\tcarrying  and\\n    nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever\\n    and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul\\tto  the  Lord\\n    while gazing at a crucifix.\\n\\n    Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his\\n    humility, purity and confidence in prayer.\\n\\n    Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.\\n\\n    - Brendan Arthur\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of\\n    others as a sword is to a soldier\\n\\nGod Bless\\n\\nFrom Simon\\nLines:  106\\n-- \\n/----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\\\\\\n|  Simon P.

There\\nis a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts\\nwithout active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really\\nbeautiful way to hear the Passion is it\\'s being chanted by three\\ndeacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants\\nin the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor.\\nThis is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion\\nthat John would prefer.\\n\\nBut there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations.\\nEach pastor makes his own decisions (it isn\\'t a church-wide conspiracy\\nagainst participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial\\nblessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already\\ngetting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they\\nshould not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the\\norchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation\\nin the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation\\n--- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be\\nnecessary to go with the briefer options just to \"get \\'em in and get \\'em\\nout\".\\n\\nEach parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to\\ntheir geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish\\nin the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy\\ncloser to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow\\nparishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors\\ngenerally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though\\nyou probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly\\nto the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.\\n\\nPerhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn\\'t follow\\nthe continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no\\nsingle one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated\\nequilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them,\\nthen the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering\\nthe names of the evolutionary theories.}\\n-- \\n                                                    --- Tim Rolfe\\n                                                 rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu\\n                                                 rolfe@junior.dsu.edu\\n                                                RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu\\n',\n",

If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n>It is very natural to think that\\n>the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic\\n>structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm\\n>shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of \\n>the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial \\n>revolution.  Well, rules have changed and the status quo has driven \\n>Muslim countries into misery trying to survive in a \"heathen\" world. \\n>Muslim countries have failed economically, they were unable to \\n>accumulate any wealth - directly due to the uncomprimising economic\\n>rules in the Quran. In fact, the rise of Islam can easily be modeled\\n>after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home,\\n>but increase your wealth by conquering places.  \\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n>When this stopped,\\n>you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour.\\n>No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education\\n>level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health\\n>statistics are miserable etc.. \\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n>You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims \\n>for following the Quran. \\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n>Your idea is baseless from historical\\n>facts, it is a poor utopia, \\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n>while my ideas are derived from social\\n>and economic history. \\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n>My solution to all Muslims is simple:\\n>CUT THE CRAP, \\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n>GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT \\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n>AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE\\n>THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

Overacker) writes:\\n\\n   You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I\\'m not trying to be\\n   contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction\\n   and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions?\\n   What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that\\n   Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time?\\n   This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically\\n   stood by the Pope.\\n\\nThe ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This\\nis the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his\\ndeparture from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands\\nfrom *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be\\ndisobeyed.\\n\\nMy own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major\\nway.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it\\nwould be too complex for people to figure out.  I don\\'t view the\\npresent situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated.\\nRun through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the\\nCatholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.\\n\\n   It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is\\n   disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over\\n   authority and discipline.  \\n\\nThe problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic\\nFaith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the\\nCatholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring\\nbishops.  It\\'s basically the Reformation part II.\\n\\nThere is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the\\nshards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the\\nCatholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an\\nhour, probably.\\n\\nTake the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I\\'m reading a book\\non what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio\\nde Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the\\nwake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old\\ncatechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the\\nCatholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He\\ninnoculated the people against what was coming.\\n\\nWell, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came\\nwhen the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope\\nrecovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really\\nwanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence.\\nThe Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.\\n\\nThe injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop\\nwas installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer\\'s\\nclergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New\\nMass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass.\\nThe people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop\\nwas *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of\\nthe secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The\\npriests would just start building new churches; the people were\\ncompletely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the\\nbishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.\\n\\nThe prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to\\ncanon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the\\ntraditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V.\\nNor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.\\n\\nDuring all this process, the people of Campos, not just private\\nindividuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending\\npetitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist\\nbishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome.\\nEventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.\\n\\n   My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:\\n\\n\\t Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms\\n\\t could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that\\n\\t the Pope\\'s position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX\\n\\t don\\'t jointly make such  choice.)\\n\\n   If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority.\\n   If I adopt the view that \"I\\'m NOT wrong, I CAN\\'T be wrong, and\\n   there\\'s NO WAY I\\'ll change my mind, YOU must change yours\", that\\n   I\\'ve either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.\\n\\nIf the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end\\nof the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in\\nCatholic theology, and anyone who doesn\\'t go along with it is an\\ninstant non-Catholic.\\n\\nThe problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in\\nthe Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are\\ndoing, they would be shocked!\\n\\n   We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the \"real\"\\n   traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter\\n   East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body\\nof traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are\\nespecially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional\\ndoctrine is.\\n\\n   I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow\\n   error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.`\\n   I may be wrong here, I\\'m not Roman Catholic. :-)\\n\\nThat\\'s heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job\\nsince the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors\\nspread that it\\'s pitiful.\\n\\nInfallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the\\nshort term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In\\nfact, that\\'s what usually happens during a major heresy: large\\nsections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been\\nmuch more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long\\nrun.\\n\\n   What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement\\n   regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how\\n   do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility?\\n   Again, I\\'m not trying to be contentions, I\\'m trying to understand.\\n   Since I\\'m Orthodox, I\\'ve got no real vested interest in the outcome,\\n   one way or the other.\\n\\nYes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what\\nis he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of\\nthe Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic\\nschools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for\\nthat professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?\\n\\n   It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the\\n   Pope\\'s commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.\\n\\nNot really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last\\n300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at\\ncritical thought, remember?  That\\'s what Catholic theologians have\\nbeen busy at for centuries.\\n',\n",

But I ask, what holds  \\nsomeone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by \\nfaith?\\n\\n[ a couple of paragraphs deleted.  Summary: we ask \"Why does the\\nuniverse exist\" ]\\n\\n= I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely\\n= \\n= 1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?\\n= \\n= and\\n= \\n= 2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?\\n= \\n= It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However,\\n= is it a meaningful question, after all?\\n=\\n= I would say it isn\\'t. Consider the following:\\n\\nApparently it *is* for many persons.  Hence, we *have* religions.\\n\\n= The question \"why anything exists\" can be countered by\\n= demanding answer to a question \"why there is nothing in nothingness,\\n= or in non-existence\".  Actually, both questions turn out to be\\n= devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don\\'t exist\\n= don\\'t exist. Tautology at its best.\\n\\nCarefully examine the original question, and then the \"counter-question\". \\nThe first asks \"Why\", while the second is a request for definition.  It \\ndoesn\\'t address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define \\nthe lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for\\nhow do we identify something as \"nothing\" (aren\\'t they mutually exclusive\\nterms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is\\nnearing the limits of this simple layman\\'s ability to comprehend, and I\\nwould appreciate an explanation). \\n\\nI might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\\ndon\\'t...don\\'t\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\\nas does the theist\\'s belief in God.  It is based on the assumption\\nthat there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately\\n(un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very\\nfoundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a\\nreason.\\n\\nWe come to this. Either \"I am, therefore I am.\", or \"I am for a reason.\"\\nIf the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are\\nsatisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just\\nbeginning.  \\n\\n= I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.\\n\\nTime will tell. 8^)\\n\\n= \\n= Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is\\n= Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this\\n= answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is\\n= actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and\\n= them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.\\n\\nAgreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as\\nwell.\\n\\n= Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence.\\n= This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God\\n= Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence,\\n= it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always\\n= existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.\\n\\nThis does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His\\n*qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).\\n\\n= The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable\\n= of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not\\n= accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.\\n\\nLike the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes \\nthat the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against \\nscientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in\\nwhich we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I\\nseek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the\\nCreator.\\n\\nI also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer \"why\".   It\\nappears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is\\ninadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting\\nthat \\'why\\' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  \\n\\n= : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a \"why\".  That isn\\'t\\n= : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).\\n= \\n= This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us \"how\",\\n= not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the \"why\"\\n= questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the\\n= supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is\\n= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.\\n\\nMy apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\\npre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\\n\\nBut we come to the admission that science fails to answer \"Why?\".  Because\\nit can\\'t be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the\\nquestion invalid?\\n= : I don\\'t believe *any*\\n= : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite\\n= : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.\\n= \\n= This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are\\n= somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians\\n= in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce\\n= they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?\\n\\nI suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was \\n*vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming\\n\"Inquisition!\", note I said *vindicated*.

I\\'ve\\n     known Muslims who were once Christians and vice\\n     versa, I\\'ve known Christians who were once\\n     Jewish and vice versa, and I\\'ve even known\\n     Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout\\n     their transition from one faith to another,\\n     they\\'ve kept this belief in some form of higher\\n     \"being.\"  Why?\\n     \\nIt usually all has to do with how the child is\\n     brought up.  From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.  Once the child is able\\n     to read for himself, there is an endeavor to\\n     inculcate the child the \"right\" readings of\\n     scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant\\n     readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to\\n     explain away the unexplainable with \"mystery.\"\\n     Circular arguments, \"self-evdent\" facts and\\n     \"truths,\" unreasoning belief, and fear of\\n     hell is the meat of religion the child must eat\\n     of every day.

Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd.

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)\\n===================================================\\n\\nGRASS\\n-----\\n  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army\\n  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and\\n  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a\\n  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,\\n  although it is reported to have significant image processing\\n  capabilities.\\n\\n  Feature Descriptions\\n\\n  I use GRASS  because it\\'s public domain and can be obtained through the\\n  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source\\n  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass\\n  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using\\n  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who\\n  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.

Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.

We are not\\nsaved by what we do.  However,\\n\\n15 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\\n(John 14:15).\\n\\nKeeping Christ\\'s commandments is a \"work\" per se, and a demonstration of\\nour love for him.  Also,\\n\\n6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his\\nvineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none.\\n7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years\\nI come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why\\ncumbereth it the ground?\\n8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I\\nshall dig about it, and dung it:\\n9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it\\ndown.\\n(Luke 13:6-9).\\n\\nAgain,\\n\\n16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye\\nshould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that\\nwhatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.\\n(John 15:16).\\n\\nIt is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. \\nWhat is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being\\nlove, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest\\nin the actions that we carry out.\\n\\nIf a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things\\nChrist commanded, I dare say, that they really don\\'t have any faith. \\nAsking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade\\non a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your\\npants is more important.\\n\\nGood works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith,\\ntrue faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable\\nabove speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs\\ncommands are actions, and if we don\\'t do those actions and produce fruit,\\nthen we shall be uprooted just like the tree. \\n\\nIt is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.

These finer particles are considered hazardous because \\nthey are small enough penetrate into the lung.  Cities are considered out of \\ncompliance with clean air laws if the 24-hour average concentration of PM10 \\nexceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air.  \\n     In Seattle however, a link between fine particles and asthma was found at \\nlevels as low as 30 micrograms.  The authors concluded that for every 30 \\nmicrogram increase in the four-day average of PM10, the odds of someone with \\nasthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent.  \\n     The findings were published in the April American Review of Respiratory \\nDisease, an official journal of the American Thoracic Society, the Lung \\nAssociation\\'s medical section.  \\n     The study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that \\nparticulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat.  A 1992 study \\nby Dr. Schwartz and Douglas Dockery, Ph.D., of Harvard found that particles \\nmay be causing roughly 60,000 premature deaths each year in the United States.  \\nOther studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms \\nand bronchitis in children.  \\n     \"Government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone,\" \\nsays Dr. Schwartz.  \"But more and more research is showing that particles are \\nbad actors as well.\"      One problem in setting, standards for particulate \\nair pollution is that PMIO is difficult to study.  Unlike other regulated \\npollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide, particulate matter is a complex \\nand varying mixture of substances, including carbon, hydrocarbons, dust, and \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 29\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nacid aerosols.  \\n     \"Researchers can\\'t Put people in exposure chambers to study the effects \\nof particulate air pollution,\" says Dr. Schwartz.  \"We have no way of \\nduplicating the typical urban mix of particles.  \" Consequently, most of what \\nis known about particulates has been learned through population-based research \\nlike the Seattle study.  \\n     Given that the EPA\\'s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur \\ndioxide standards, the agency is unlikely to reexamine the PM10 standard any \\ntime soon.  Until changes are made, there appears to be little people with \\nasthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles.\\n     \"In some areas, you can get reports on air quality, but the reports only \\ncover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard, and that\\'s \\nrarely particulate matter,\" says Dr.  Schwartz.  \"However, PM10 doesn\\'t have \\nto be near its violation range to be unhealthy.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 30\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n               NIH Consensus Development Conference on Melanoma\\n\\nThe National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference on \\nDiagnosis and Treatment of Early Melanoma brought together experts in \\ndermatology, pathology, epidemiology, public education, surveillance \\ntechniques, and potential new technologies as well as other health care \\nprofessionals and the public to address (1) the clinical and histological \\ncharacteristics of early melanoma; (2) the appropriate diagnosis, management, \\nand followup of patients with early melanoma; (3) the role of dysplastic nevi \\nand their significance; and (4) the role of education and screening in \\npreventing melanoma morbidity and mortality.

Within the program, there are four types \\nof cancer centers:  basic science cancer centers (14), which engage primarily \\nin basic cancer research; clinical cancer centers (12), which focus on \\nclinical research; \"comprehensive\" cancer centers (28), which emphasize a \\nmultidisciplinary approach to cancer research, patient care, and community \\noutreach; and consortium cancer centers (1), which specialize in cancer \\nprevention and control research. \\n \\nAlthough some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s, it was \\nthe National Cancer Act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new \\ncancer centers, as well as continuing support for existing ones.  The passage \\nof the act also dramatically transformed the centers\\' structure and broadened \\nthe scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic, clinical, and \\ncancer control research.  Over the next two decades, the centers\\' program grew \\nprogressively. \\n \\nIn 1990, there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation. Today, \\nthere are 28 of these institutions, all of which meet specific NCI criteria \\nfor comprehensive status. \\n \\nTo attain recognition from the NCI as a comprehensive cancer center, an \\ninstitution must pass rigorous peer review.  Under guidelines newly \\nestablished in 1990, the eight criteria for \"comprehensiveness\" include the \\nrequirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in \\nseveral scientific fields, such as biology and molecular genetics, a strong \\nprogram of clinical research, and an ability to transfer research findings \\ninto clinical practice. \\n \\nMoreover, five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly \\nbeyond that required for attaining a Cancer Center Support Grant (also \\nreferred to as a P30 or core grant), the mechanism of choice for supporting \\nthe infrastructure of a cancer center\\'s operations.  These criteria encompass \\nstrong participation in NCI-designated high-priority clinical trials, \\nsignificant levels of cancer prevention and control research, and important \\noutreach and educational activities--all of which are funded by a variety of \\nsources. \\n \\nThe other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and \\ncapabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit \\nimportant new findings or address timely research questions. \\n \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 32\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nOf the 55 NCI-designated Cancer Centers, 14 are of the basic science type.  \\nThese centers engage almost entirely in basic research, although some centers \\nengage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators \\nand in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications \\nfrom new discoveries in the laboratory. \\n \\nClinical cancer centers, in contrast, focus on both basic research and \\nclinical research within the same institutional framework, and frequently \\nincorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their \\noverall research programs.  There are 12 such centers today. \\n \\nFinally, consortium cancer centers, of which there is one, are uniquely \\nstructured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and \\ncontrol research.  These centers interface with state and local public health \\ndepartments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention \\nand control techniques from their research findings to those institutions \\nresponsible for implementing population-wide public health programs.  \\nConsortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with \\ninstitutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community \\nhospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials. \\n \\nTogether, the 55 NCI-Designated Cancer Centers continue to work toward \\ncreating new and innovative approaches to cancer research, and through \\ninterdisciplinary efforts, to effectively move this research from the \\nlaboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice. \\n \\nComprehensive Cancer Centers (Internet addresses are given where available) \\n \\nUniversity of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center\\nBasic Health Sciences Building, Room 108\\n1918 University Boulevard\\nBirmingham, Alabama 35294\\n(205) 934-6612\\n \\nUniversity of Arizona Cancer Center\\n1501 North Campbell Avenue\\nTucson, Arizona 85724\\n(602) 626-6372\\nInternet:  syd@azcc.arizona.edu\\n \\nJonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center\\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\\n200 Medical Plaza\\nLos Angeles, California 90027\\n(213) 206-0278\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 33\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nInternet:  rick@jccc.medsch.ucla.edu\\n \\nKenneth T.

The \\ndecision ends the controversy between Army AIDS researchers who had hoped to \\ntest a vaccine made by  MicroGeneSys Inc. and the National Institutes of \\nHealth, which  contended that multiple vaccines should be tested.  Health and  \\nHuman Services Secretary Donna Shalala said a final announcement  on the \\ntherapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last  Friday.  Companies \\nincluding Genentech Inc., Chiron Corp., and  Immuno AG have already told NIH \\nthat they are prepared to  participate in the vaccine tests.  The testing is \\nintended to  demonstrate whether AIDS vaccines are effective in thwarting the  \\nreplication of HIV in patients already infected.  Shalala refuted last week\\'s \\nreports that the Clinton administration had decided  the Army\\'s test of the \\nMicroGeneSys VaxSyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time.  \\n\"The report was inaccurate,  and I expect there to be some announcement in the \\nnext 24 hours  about that particular AIDS research project,\" said Shalala.   \\nAdministration sources subsequently confirmed that NIH director  Dr. Bernadine \\nHealy and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David Kessler had \\nconvinced the White House that multiple  vaccines should be tested \\nsimultaneously.  But MicroGeneSys  president Frank Volvovitz said a test of \\nmultiple vaccines could  triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two \\nyears.\\n\\n==================================================================    \\n\\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 41\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\n\"The Limits of AZT\\'s Impact on HIV\" U.S. News & World Report (04/12/93) Vol. \\n114, No. 14, P. 18 \\n\\n     AZT has become the most widely used drug to fight AIDS since it  was \\napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987.

However, a team of  European researchers recently reported that \\nalthough HIV-positive patients taking AZT demonstrated a slightly lower risk \\nof  developing AIDS within the first year of treatment, that benefit  \\ndisappeared two years later.  The Lancet published preliminary  findings of \\nthe three-year study, which could give more reason  for critics to argue the \\ndrug\\'s cost, side effects, and general  efficacy.

If the code was once perfect, and\\nhas degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour\\nof this statement, shouldn\\'t we?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest \"imperfection\" of the code is that it is full\\nof non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they\\nintervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.

Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: >>causing infection and disease.

Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\\n\\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\\n  \\n: Oh, I admit it\\'s not perfect (yet).

They don\\'t explain\\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\\n\\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.

Nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women \\nposter for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did \\nnot exist.  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I \\nsee that you and some of the others are doing it here as well.  \\n\\nLet me tell you who the quacks really are, these are the physicans who have \\nno idea how the human body interacts with it\\'s environment and how that \\nbalance can be altered by diet and antibiotics.  These are the physicians \\nwho dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go \\nfrom doctor to doctor to find relief(like Elaine in Sci. Med. Nutrition) and \\nthen when they find one that solves their problem, the rest start yelling \\nquack.  Could it just be professional jealousy?  I couldn\\'t help Elaine or Jon\\nbut somebody else did.  Could they know more than Me?  No way, they must be a \\nquack.  \\n\\nI\\'ve been teaching a human nutrition course for Medical students for over ten \\nyears now and guess who the most receptive students are?  Those that were \\nraised on farms and saw first-hand the effect of diet on the health of their \\nfarm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to \\nentering medical school(switched to the vegan diet).  Typically, this is \\nabout 1/3 of my class of 90 students.  Those not interested in nutrition \\neither tune me out or just stop coming to class.  That\\'s okay because I \\nknow that some of what I\\'m teaching is going to stick and there will be at \\nleast a few \"enlightened\" physicians practicing in the U.S.  It\\'s really \\ntoo bad that most U.S. medical schools don\\'t cover nutrition because if \\nthey did, candida would not be viewed as a non-disease by so many in the \\nmedical profession.\\n\\nIn animal husbandry, an animal is reinnoculated with \"good\" bacteria after \\nantibiotics are stopped.  Medicine has decided that since humans do not \\nhave a ruminant stomach, no such reinnoculation with \"good\" bacteria is \\nneeded after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic.  Humans have all \\nkinds of different organisms living in the GI system(mouth, stomach, small \\nand large intestine), sinuses, vagina and on the skin.  These are \\nnonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune \\nsystem is compromised.  They are also called nonpathogens because unlike \\nthe pathogenic organisms that cause human disease, they do not produce \\ntoxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body.  But any of \\nthese organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up \\nresidence within the body.  A poor mucus membrane barrier can let this \\nhappen and vitamin A is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier.\\nSteve got real upset with Elaine\\'s doctor because he was using anti-fungals \\nand vitamin A for her GI problems.  If Steve really understoood what \\nvitamin A does in the body, he would not(or at least should not) be calling \\nElaine\\'s doctor a quack.\\n\\nHere is a brief primer on yeast.  Yeast infections, as they are commonly \\ncalled, are not truely caused by yeasts.  The most common organism responsible\\nfor this type of infection is Candida albicans or Monilia which is actually a \\nyeast-like fungus.  An infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis.\\nCandidiasis is a very rare occurance because, like an E. Coli infection, it \\nrequires that the host immune system be severly depressed.  \\n\\nCandida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of \\nnormal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing\\nfactor is present such as a high blood glucose level(diabetes) or an oral \\ncourse of antibiotics has been used.  In diabetics, their secretions contain \\nmuch higher amounts of glucose.  Candida, unlike bacteria, is very limited in \\nit\\'s food(fuel) selection.  Without glucose, it can not grow, it just barely \\nsurvives.  If it gets access to a lot of glucose, it blooms and over rides \\nthe other organisms living with it in the sinuses, GI tract or vagina.  In \\ndiabetics, skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little \\nbuggers.  The bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but \\nsome people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus \\nmembrane or skin bloom site.  Whether this is an allergic like reaction to \\nthe candida or not isn\\'t certain.  When the bloom is in the vagina or on \\nthe skin, it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to \"treat\" it.\\nIf it\\'s internal, only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty \\nnondiscript.  \\n\\n\\nCandida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in \\nthe sinuses, the GI tract(mouth, stomach and intestines) and in the \\nvaginal tract which compete with it for food.  The human immune system \\nususally does not bother itself with these(nonpathogenic organisms) unless \\nthey broach the mucus membrane \"barrier\".  If they do, an inflammatory \\nresponse will be set up.  Most Americans are not getting enough vitamin A \\nfrom their diets.  About 30% of all American\\'s die with less Vitamin A than \\nthey were born with(U.S. autopsy studies).  While this low level of vitamin \\nA does not cause pathology(blindness) it does impair the mucus membrane \\nbarrier system.  This would then be a predisposing factor for a strong \\ninflammatory response after a candida bloom.  \\n\\nWhile diabetics can suffer from a candida \"bloom\" the  most common cause of \\nthis type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which \\nknock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main \\ncompetition for candida as far as food is concerned.  While drugs are \\navailable to handle candida, many patients find that their doctor will not \\nuse them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection.  The toxicity of \\nthe anti-fungal drugs does warrant some caution.  But if the GI or sinus \\ninflammation is suspected to be candida(and recent use of a broad spectrum \\nantibiotic is the smoking gun), then anti-fungal use should be approrpriate \\njust as the anti-fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring \\nvaginal yeast infections, in spite of what Mr. Steve Dyer says.\\n\\nBut even in patients being given the anti-fungals, the irritation caused by \\nthe excessive candida bloom in the sinus, GI tract or the vagina tends to \\nreturn after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of \\nthe problem is addressed(lack of a \"good\" bacterial flora in the body and/or \\npoor mucus membrane barrier).  Lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective \\ntherapy for candida overgrowth.  From it\\'s name, it is an acid loving \\norganism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows.  Candida can not \\ngrow very well in an acidic environment.  In the vagina, L. acidophilius is \\nthe predominate bacteria(unless you are hit with broad spectrum \\nantibiotics).  \\n\\nIn the GI system, the ano-rectal region seems to be a particularly good \\nreservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very \\nfavorable environment around the rectum for transfer(through moisture and \\nhumidity) of candida to the vaginal tract.  One of the most effctive ways to \\nminimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear.  \\n\\nIf the bloom occurs in the anal area, the burning, swelling, pain and even \\nblood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids.  If the \\nbloom manages to move further up the GI tract, very diffuse symptomatology \\noccurs(abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool).  This positive stool \\nfor occult blood is what sent Elaine to her family doctor in the first \\nplace.  After extensive testing, he told her that there was nothing wrong \\nbut her gut still hurt.  On to another doctor, and so on.  Richard Kaplan \\nhas told me throiugh e-mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool \\nspecimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of \\nfalse positives(candida blooms guys?).  If my gut hurt me on a constant \\nbasis, I would want it fixed.  Yes it\\'s nice to know that I don\\'t have \\ncolon cancer but what then is causing my distress?  When I finally find a \\ndoctor who treats me and gets me 90% better, Steve Dyer calls him a quack.\\n\\nCandida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria \\ntend to prefer a slightly acidic environment.  The vagina becomes alkaline \\nduring a woman\\'s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina. \\nVinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal \\nproblems.  Many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of \\nLactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract(I would want to be sure of \\nthe purity of the product before trying this).  My wife had this vagina \\nproblem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year \\nuntil she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting \\nscripts for anti-fungal creams.  This was a woman gynocologist who had had \\nthe same problem(recurring vaginal yeast infections).  This M.D. did some \\ndigging and came up with an acetic acid and L. Acidophilis douche which she \\nused in your office to keep it sterile.  After three treatments, sex \\nreturned to our marraige.  I have often wondered what an M.D. with chronic \\nGI distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his \\npatients is a non-existent syndrome.\\n\\nThe nonpathogenic bacteria L. acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria \\nwhich is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women.  \\nIf taken orally, it can also become a major bacteria in the gut.  Through \\naresol sprays, it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes.\\nBut before this innoculation occurs, the mucus membrane barrier system \\nneeds to be strengthened.  This is accomplished by vitamin A, vitamin C and \\nsome of the B-complex vitamins.  Diet surveys repeatedly show that Americans \\nare not getting enough B6 and folate.  These are probably the segement of \\nthe population that will have the greatest problem with this non-existent \\ndisorder(candida blooms after antibiotic therapy).\\n \\nSome of the above material was obtained from \"Natural Healing\" by Mark \\nBricklin, Published by Rodale press, as well as notes from my human \\nnutrition course.  I will be posting a discussion of vitamin A  sometime in \\nthe future, along with reference citings to point out the extremely \\nimportant role that vitamin A plays in the mucus membrane defense system in \\nthe body and why vitamin A should be effective in dealing with candida \\nblooms.  Another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate \\nintake during the treatment phase, this is especially important if the GI \\nsystem is involved.  If candida can not get glucose, it\\'s not going to out \\ngrow the bacteria and you then give bacteria, which can use amino acids and \\nfatty acids for energy, a chance to take over and keep the candida in check \\nonce carbohydrate is returned to the gut.\\n\\nIf Steve and some of the other nay-sayers want to jump all over this post, \\nfine.  I jumped all over Steve in Sci. Med. Nutrition because he verbably \\naccosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor\\'s use of vitamin \\nA and anti-fungals for a candida bloom in her gut.  People seeking advice \\nfrom newsnet should not be treated this way.  Those of us giving of our \\ntime and knowledge can slug it out to our heart\\'s content.  If you saved \\nyour venom for me Steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly \\nseeking help alone, I wouldn\\'t have a problem with your behavior. \\n \\nMartin Banschbach, Ph.D.\\nProfessor of Biochemistry and Chairman\\nDepartment of Biochemistry and Microbiology\\nOSU College of Osteopathic Medicine\\n1111 West 17th St.\\nTulsa, Ok. 74107\\n\\n\"Without discourse, there is no remembering, without remembering, there is \\nno learning, without learning, there is only ignorance\".\\n',\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nJohn Bradley\\'s free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,\\nGIF, and other image formats.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\nor ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? is the\\nversion number, currently 2.21); it is located in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits\\ninternally, which means it\\'s not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color images to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantized first.\\nBut XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.

Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).

In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nI have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,\\nbut surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not\\nnecessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,\\nCambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.\\n\\n\\nPortable software for almost any system:\\n\\nIf none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free\\nJPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether\\nthe product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can\\nhandle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are\\nnot and never will be compatible with anyone else\\'s files.\\n\\n\\n[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:\\n\\nFree, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent\\nJPEG Group, which I lead.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n\\n-- \\n\\t\\t\\ttom lane\\n\\t\\t\\torganizer, Independent JPEG Group\\nInternet: tgl@cs.cmu.edu\\tBITNET: tgl%cs.cmu.edu@carnegie\\n',\n",

That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have\\nmade any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying\\nthat they are infallible.\\n\\nImpicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will\\nprobably agree.\\n\\nIn short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any\\npart of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning,\\nthen those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved,\\nthere is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing \"There\\nis no way out of the loop.\"\\n\\n\\nSomeone called `REXLEX\\' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but\\nhe did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase\\nSartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument\\nleads to relativism.\\n\\nAs I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false\\nbecause you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because\\nyou dislike them.  `REXLEX\\' wrote:\\n\\n>  I disagree with Dr Nancy\\'s Sweetie\\'s conclusion because if it is\\n> taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.\\n\\nHowever, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX\\' has\\nwritten does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does\\nnot like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThere were two sentences in `REXLEX\\'s post that seemed relevant to the\\npoint at hand:\\n\\n>  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be\\n> experienced and it is verifiable.\\n\\nI do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I\\nhave, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don\\'t claim to\\nbe infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I\\ndo claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.\\n\\nHowever, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about\\nthem, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier\\narticle.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted\\nin very limited circumstances.\\n\\n\\n>  It is only because of God\\'s own revelation that we can be absolute\\n> about a thing.\\n\\nBut how far does that get you?  Once God\\'s revelation stops, and your own\\nreasoning begins, possibility for error appears.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s suppose that our modern Bible translations include a\\nperfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said,\\nexactly, \"This is my body.\"\\n\\nWe\\'ll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely\\ntrue.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.\\n\\nAt the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the\\npossibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do\\nnot have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of\\nTran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn\\'t say.  We interpret this passage\\nusing our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know\\nthat our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This\\nis something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)\\n\\nWhy should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be\\nfallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?\\n\\nSo, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is\\nthat Jesus said \"This is my body.\"  Beyond that, once we start making up\\ndoctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we\\nget into trouble.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain\\nof.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they\\ncannot be certain.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know\\nthat human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not\\nbelieve we are infallible, any more than we do.\\n\\nWhen Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead\\nthem astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non-\\nChristians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is\\nhardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you\\nare either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying\\nto cover them up.\\n\\nI think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what\\nthings we are only \"very confident\" of.  For example, we might say that we\\nknow our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But\\nother things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical\\nthinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are\\nvery confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.\\n\\nBut, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting\\nas if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.\\n\\n *\\n\\n`REXLEX\\' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by\\nFrancis Schaeffer.  I didn\\'t think very highly of it, but I think that\\nMr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody\\nelse might like it, though, so don\\'t let my opinion stop you from reading it.\\n\\nIf someone is interested in my opinion, I\\'d suggest _On Certainty_, by\\nLudwig Wittgenstein.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\"If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some\\n Wittgenstein, 60% of the postings would disappear.

The Jews of Jesus\\'s time believed that all sickness was the\\nresult of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was\\nblind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any\\nother STD is a *punishment\" for sexual sin, what do we do with \\ndiseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as\\ndebilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a\\nspecific behavior or lifestyle?\\n>\\n>In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things.\\n>There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ?\\n>I don\\'t know.\\n\\nAtonement is *extremely* important, but I think you\\'ve missed the mark\\nabout as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin.\\nThe atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central\\nmessage of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins,\\nand was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of\\nour sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for\\nour sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He\\nhas graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or \\nsome other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting\\non the sacrifice that Jesus made.\\n\\nIn case you couldn\\'t tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when\\nI see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and\\nphobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other\\nsocially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through\\ntheir own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ,\\nno more and no less than we do.  I\\'ve said this before, but I think\\nit\\'s a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus\\nhealed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on\\nthis earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS.\\nShe has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed \\nrelationship with God.  Her theology isn\\'t what I would want it to be,\\nbut God\\'s grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining\\nweight (she\\'s had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is\\nexcellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes\\nher improvement in her health to God\\'s intervention in her life.  Who\\nare we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It\\nseems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.\\n\\nPaul Overstreet, the country singer, has a good song title that I \\nthink applies to all of us - But for the Grace of God, There Go I\\n(or something like that).\\n\\nMay we all experience and accept God\\'s grace.\\n>\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n>Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: The opinions expressed\\n>marka@gcx1.ssd.csd.harris.com      |here are my own; they do not\\n>..!uunet!gcx1!marka               |reflect the opinion or policies\\n>The Lost Los Angelino              |of Harris Corporation.\\n>-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nPaul Conditt\\t\\tInternet: conditt@titan.tsd.arlut.utexas.edu\\nApplied Research\\tPhone:\\t  (512) 835-3422   FAX: (512) 835-3416/3259\\n  Laboratories\\t\\tFedex:\\t  10000 Burnet Road, Austin, Texas 78758-4423\\nUniversity of Texas\\tPostal:\\t  P.O.

I don't really know the difference\\nbetween the various Protestant denominations.\\n\\nThanks for reading my post. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSteve Hoskins\\n\\n[Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an\\nintroduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible\\ncourses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary\\nstyles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further\\nreading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT\\nintroduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They\\noften have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best\\nrecommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (I\\nthink there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a\\nfairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the\\nSociety for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy,\\nyou will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read a\\nlot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald\\nGuthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's also\\neditor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]\\n\",\n",

The real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde\\n>produced are high enough to cause significant damage, as both are toxic to\\n>living cells.  All I can say is that I will not consume it.  \\n\\n[...]\\n\\n   In the September 1992 issue of THE TUFTS UNIVERSITY DIET AND NUTRITION\\n   LETTER, there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners.  What\\n   follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with Nutrasweet.\\n\\n   [Reproduced without permission]\\n\\n\\t   The controversy [over aspartame] began six years ago in England,\\n\\twhere a group of researchers found that aspartame, marketed under\\n\\tthe tradename Nutrasweet, appears to stimulate appetite and,\\n\\tpresumably, the eating of more calories in the long run than if\\n\\ta person simply consumed sugar.  When researchers asked a group\\n\\tof 95 people to drink plain water, aspartame-sweetened water, and\\n\\tsugared water, they said that overall they felt hungriest after\\n\\tdrinking the artificially sweetened beverage.\\n\\t   The study received widespread media attention and stirred a\\n\\tgood deal of concern among the artificial-sweetener-using public.\\n\\tHowever, its results were questionable at best, since the researchers\\n\\tdid not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did\\n\\tactually translate into an increase in eating.  The two do not\\n\\tnecessarily go hand in hand.\\n\\t   In the years that followed, more than a dozen studies examining\\n\\tthe effect of aspartame on appetite -- and eating -- were conducted.\\n\\tAnd after reviewing every one of them, the director of the\\n\\tLaboratory of the Study of Human Ingestive Behavior at Johns Hopkins\\n\\tUniversity, Barbara Rolls, Ph.D., concluded that consuming aspartame-\\n\\tsweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in\\n\\tthe amount of food eaten afterward.\\n\\n\\t   One artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing\\n\\tcancer is aspartame.  But it most certainly has been blamed for a\\n\\thost of other ills.  Since its introduction in 1981, the government\\n\\thas received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing\\n\\teverything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety.\\n\\tStill, years of careful scientific study conducted both before and\\n\\tafter the sweetener\\'s entering the market have failed to confirm\\n\\tthat it can bring about adverse health effects.  That\\'s why the\\n\\tCenters for Disease Control (the government agency charged with\\n\\tmonitoring public health), the American Medical Association\\'s\\n\\tCouncil on Scientific Affairs, and the Food and Drug Administration\\n\\thave given aspartame, one of the most studied food additives, a\\n\\tclean bill of health.\\n\\t   Granted, the FDA has set forth an \"acceptable daily intake\" of\\n\\t50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight.  To exceed\\n\\tthe limit, however, a 120-pound (55 kg.) woman would have to take\\n\\tin 2,750 milligrams of aspartame -- the amount in 15 cans of\\n\\taspartame-sweetened soda pop, 14 cups of gelatin, 22 cups of yogurt,\\n\\tor 55 six-ounce servings of aspartame-containing hot cocoa,...\\n\\tA 175-pound (80 kg.) man would have to consume some 4,000 milligrams\\n\\tof the sweetener -- the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups\\n\\tof yogurt -- to go over the limit.  [chart with aspartame content\\n\\tof selected foods omitted]\\n\\t   Only one small group of people must be certain to stay away\\n\\tfrom aspartame: those born with a rare metabolic disorder called\\n\\tphenylketonuria, or PKU.  The estimated one person in every 12,000\\n\\tto 15,000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential\\n\\tamino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine.  Once a child\\n\\tconsumes it, it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause\\n\\tsuch severe problems as mental retardation.  To help people with\\n\\tPKU avoid the substance, labels on cans of soda pop and other\\n\\taspartame-sweetened foods must carry the warning \"Phenylketonurics:\\n\\tContains Phenylalanine.\"\\n\\n\\n-Rich Young (These are not Kodak\\'s opinions.)\\n\\n',\n",

Correspondingly, JSTMP consists of three major components:\\n\\n1. TRAINING IN THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE\\nSeveral Japanese language courses will be offered, including intensive courses\\ndesigned to expedite language preparation for scientists and engineers in a\\nrelatively short time.\\n\\n2. EDUCATION IN JAPANESE BUSINESS AND SOCIAL CULTURE\\nA particular enphasis is placed on attaining a deep understanding of the\\ncultural and educational basis of Japanese management approaches in \\nmanufacturing and information technology.  Courses will be available in a \\nvariety of departments throughout both universities including Anthropology,\\nSociology, History, and Political Science.  Moreover, seminars and colloquiums\\nwill be conducted.  Further, a field trip to Japanese manufacturing or \\nresearch facilities in the United States will be scheduled.\\n\\n\\n3.

This is in response to a question about\\nthe Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification\\nup to our Catholic readers.  --clh]\\n\\nThere is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the\\nmention of Mary\\'s _blessedness_/full of grace in the \"Annunciation\" by\\nAngel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28\\n\\n And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto\\n a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a\\n man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin\\'s\\n name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _\"Hail,\\n thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed\\n art thou among women.\"_\\n\\nNow, now, hold that line of thought - \"the Lord is with Mary &\\nblessed art thou among women\" - while you read on....\\n\\nIn the book, \"First Lady of the World, A Popular History of\\nDevotion to Mary\" by Peter Lappin:\\n\\nThe _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated\\nthan the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible\\nthat the feast of _Mary\\'s Conception_ under the title \"The Conception\\nof Saint Anne\", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of\\na woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter,\\njust as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in\\nemphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle\\nof grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary\\nis the incorruptible timber \"out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_\\nof Christ\\'s sinless body\"; she is \"God\\'s Eden, in whom there is\\nno tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.\"  Her perfect\\nbeauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her\\npurity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus,\\nshe was hailed as \"innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate,\\nspotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from\\namong thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve\".\\n...\\nAt the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan,\\nJohn Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a \\ngreater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all\\nsin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_.\\n...\\n\\nNow let\\'s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin.\\nFrom \"Pocket Catholic Cathechism\" by John A. Hardon:\\n\\nBaptism -\\nConcupiscence Remains after Baptism.\\nConcupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized\\nbut since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to\\ninjure those who do not consent and who by the grace of\\nChrist Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).\\n\\nOriginal gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall:\\nIn the light of the foregoing, we see that our first\\nparents were originally gifted three times over:\\n-They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the\\n power to think and to choose freely.\\n-The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality\\n and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires.\\n-They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace,\\n the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding\\n title to enter heaven.\\nBy their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and\\npreternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without\\nlosing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose\\nfreely.\\n\\nBaptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam\\'s\\nsin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts\\nbut gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our\\nbodies on the last day...\\n\\nGoing back to _Immaculate Conception_\\n(I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other\\nbooks but it may be another contribution to the \\'puzzle\\'):\\n\\nGiven the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a\\nnon-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born \\nAND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary\\'s birth but\\nSTILL, the Angel Gabriel\\'s greetings was:\\n\"Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you.\\nBlessed art thou amongst women\".\\n\\nEven Mary was confused about this greeting.\\n\\nMary could very well have possessed all of the\\n_treefold original gifts above_ given to our first\\nparents (Adam and Eve before their sin):\\n    Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel)\\n    Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural)\\n    The Lord is with you (At those times, God would\\n                definitely want to be with those He\\n                has made _blessed_)\\n    Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)\\n\\nAt the conception, God made Mary _full of grace\\nand blessed_ as the \\'tabernacle\\' for the coming body\\nof Christ and so,\\n\\nImmaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still\\nhas maintained her Immaculate Heart. \\n\\n-Marida\\n(P.S.

That His existence can be proven by reason\\nis indisputable (cf. my short treatise, \"Traditional Proofs for the \\nExistence of God,\" and Summa Theologica).\\n\\nNow, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason,\\nI assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen\\ncondition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?\\n\\nBecause God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter,\\nthe Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the\\nMeasure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order\\nto the universe (logos).\\n\\nI next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is\\ncontrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And,\\nsince God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior\\nas early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because\\na human (Adam) was first responsible for man\\'s alienation from the Source\\nof all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship.\\nThus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.\\n\\nNow this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim\\nis true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.\\n\\nYou next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United\\nStates Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent\\ninstructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will\\nreply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned,\\nand thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For\\nexample, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton\\'s head, he could\\nhave denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must\\nbe obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true. \\n\\nTherefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.\\n\\nQED\\n \\n-- \\nboundary\\n\\nno teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he\\nvenido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) \\n',\n",

Andrew Byler)\\nSubject: The Nicene Creed (was Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY)\\nOrganization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA\\nLines: 152\\n\\nMichael Bushnell writes;\\n\\n>The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western\\n>creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that\\n>they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but\\n>it is not \"in use.\"\\n\\nWhich is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use\\nof the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it\\nsaid the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that\\nhas changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the\\nNicene - Constantinopolitan did not.\\n\\tOf course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene\\nCreed (it wasn\\'t there to begin with), but they certainly did from the\\nAthanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning.\\n\\tI might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in\\nways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East\\nemphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father\\nthrough the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the\\nSon.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see\\nbelow)\\n\\n\\t\"Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do\\ncall God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the\\nroot and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the\\nriver are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms,\\nbut coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must\\nnecessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on\\nthat account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there\\nare two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is\\nthird from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit\\nof the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river,\\nand thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36,\\nArticles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession\\nemphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the\\nFather alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called\\nunbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of\\ntheologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a\\nmatter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives\\nto the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of\\nthe Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound\\nmind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceeds from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at\\nleast), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the\\nprocession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being necessary.\\n\\tIn any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDamsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the\\nFathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic\\nposition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tAs for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Fathers of Nicea.\"  That Creed is a different Creed than that of\\nConstantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncourse in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nConstantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the\\nChurch, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council\\nChalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been\\nagainst explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves\\napproved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations\\nof the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows\\nthat the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed\\nby the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians\\nin Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until\\nmany years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was\\nnot disputed, I provide more quotes below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly\\nclear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial\\nTrinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\nis the Spirit of the Father and the Son.

       "  'From: jer@prefect.cc.bellcore.com (rathmann,janice e)\\nSubject: Re: Sinus vs. Migraine (was Re: Sinus Endoscopy)\\nOrganization: Bellcore, Livingston, NJ\\nSummary: Headaches and analgesics\\nLines: 95\\n\\n\\nI noticed several years ago that when I took analgesics fairly regularly,\\n(motrin at the time), I seemed to get a lot of migraines.  But had\\nforgotten about that until I started reading some of the posts here.\\nI generally don\\'t take NSAIDS or Tylenol for headaches, because I\\'ve\\nfound them to be ineffective.  However, I have two other pain sources\\nthat force me to take NSAIDS (currently Naprosyn).  First, is some\\npelvic pain that I get at the beginning of my period, and then much\\nworse at midcycle.  I have had surgery for endometriosis in the past\\n(~12 years ago), so the Drs. tell me that my pain is probably due\\nto the endometriosis coming back.  I\\'ve tried Synarel, it reduced\\nthe pain while I took it (3 mos), but the pain returned immediately\\nafter I stopped.  Three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the\\nonly \"real solution\" to my problem.  Although I don\\'t expect to have\\nany more children, I don\\'t like the idea of having my uterus and\\none remaining ovary removed (the first ovary was removed when I had\\nthe surgery for endometriosis).  One of the Drs that suggested\\nI get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery, but perhaps thinks\\nthat type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan\\nto have children.  So basically all I\\'m left with is toughing out\\nthe pain.  This would be impossible without Naprosyn (or something\\nsimilar - but not aspirin, that doesn\\'t work, and Motrin gave me\\nhorrible gastritis a few years ago, so I\\'m through with it).  In\\nfact, Naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if I take\\nit regularly as I did when I had severe back pain (and pain in both \\nlegs) as I\\'ll discuss in a moment.  Generally though, I wait until\\nI have the pain before I take the Naprosyn, but then it takes\\nseveral hours for it reduce the pain (it\\'s actually quite effective\\nat reducing the pain, it just takes quite a while).  In the meantime\\nI\\'m frequently in severe pain.\\n\\nThe other pain source I have is chronic lower back pain resulting in\\nbilateral radiculopathy.  I\\'ve had MRIs, Xrays, CT scan, and EMGs\\n(I\\'ve had 2 of them, and don\\'t intend to ever do that again) with\\nnerve conduction tests.  The tests have not been conclusive as to\\nwhat is causing my back and leg pain.  The MRI reports both say I have\\nseveral bulging, degeneratig disks, and from the Xrays (and MRI, I think)\\nit is apparent that I have arthritis.  The reading on the CT scan\\nwas that there are two herniations (L3-L4, and L4-L5), but others\\nhav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations.\\nThe second EMG and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation\\ncompared to the first EMG.  Oh yeah, I had some other horrible test,\\ncalled something like Somatic Evoked Response which showed that the\\n\"internal nerves\" are working fine.   Anyway, the bottom line is that\\nI sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain.  The back pain\\nis there all the time, but I can live with it.  When the leg pain is there,\\nI need some analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication to reduce the pain\\nto a level where I can work.  So I took Naprosyn regulary for 6-9\\nmonths (every time I tried to stop the leg pain got worse, so I\\'d \\nalways resume).  Since last November I have taken it much less frequently,\\nand primarily for the pelvic pain.  I have been going to physical\\ntherapy for the last 8 months (2-3 times a week).  After the first month\\nor so, my therapist put me on pelvic traction (she had tried it earlier,\\nbut it had caused a lot of pain in my back, this time she tried it at\\na lower weight).  After a month or two, the pain in my legs began going\\naway (but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back, which\\ncould be reduced with ultrasound and massage).  So now, I don\\'t have\\nnearly as much pain in my legs, in fact my therapist took me off\\ntraction about 2 weeks ago.\\n\\nGetting back to my original reason for this post...  Even if I can avoid\\ntaking analgesic for headaches, I really can\\'t avoid them entirely because\\nI have other pain sources, that \"force\" me to use them (Oh, I forgot\\nto mention that it has been suggested to me that I have back surgery,\\nbut I\\'m avoiding that too).  I find the migraines difficult to deal with,\\noccassionally I have to take off work, but usually I can work, but at\\na reduced capacity (I\\'m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading\\nand writing).  When the pelvic pain is bad, I can\\'t concentrate much,\\nI usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes, because\\nthe pain is so bothersome.  When the pain in my back is bad, it can\\ncause severe burning in both legs, shooting pains in my legs, electric\\nshock type of pain in my feet and toes, and basically when it gets bad\\nI can\\'t really sit at all.  Then I end up spending most of my time home\\nand in bed.  So even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines, the\\nmigraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources.  I get a lot\\nof migraines, an average of 3 to 4 a month, which last 1-3 days.\\nI\\'ve taken cafergot (the first time the caffiene really got to me so\\nI reduced the dosage), but I don\\'t like the side effects (if I take\\nmore than two I get diahrea).  If I get a very bad headache, I will\\neventually take the cafergot.  My neurologist wasn\\'t very helpful when\\nI told him my problems with cafergot, he said that when sumatriptan\\nbecomes available, I should try that.  I\\'ve tried several other medications\\n(fiornal, midrin, fiornal with codeine, tegretol, and inderal) but\\nthey either didn\\'t work, or I couldn\\'t tolerate them.  So what can I do?\\nMy doctor\\'s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the\\npain, which I agree with most of the time, but not when I have a lot of\\npain.  I\\'ve had some bad experiences with surgery (my heart stopped\\nonce from the anesthesia - I was told that it was likely the\\nsuccinylcholine), and I\\'ve already had surgery several times.\\n\\nAnyway, the point of what I\\'m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute\\nto migraines, some people NEED to take them to tolerate other pain.\\n\\nJanice Rathmann\\n\\n',\n",

I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.

I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic\\nand is well referenced. \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only\\nadequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are\\ndifferent by also taking into account the ways in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules\\nit would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this\\ninstance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the\\nsexism here just reflects the \"sexism\" of nature in making men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other differences between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious.\\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically\\nbecome women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for\\npregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is --\\nso your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You\\nare saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports\\nmy statement that maternity leave is sexist.\\n\\n>The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities\\n>because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.

Since this aunt and uncle have 5 kids I felt they would be more\\nrelevant than I, who have none (yet).\\n\\n>1.  Ages & sexes of children\\n     13-year-old (13YO) twins, 10YO boy, 6.5YO boy, 2YO girl\\n\\n>2.  Do you spank your kids?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking, but they do, so yes, very rarely.\\n\\n>3.  If so how often?\\n     I don\\'t call it spanking because it\\'s more of a reaction to something\\nvery dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running\\ninto the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has\\nnot been spanked yet.\\n     They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course\\nI give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they\\'re still loved.\\n\\n>4.  Do you use an implement to spank with?\\n     No, that would be too painful.  If it\\'s too traumatic they never recall\\nwhy they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time\\nto go get a toolmeans you\\'re not doing it right away, and that lessens the\\nimpact.  It\\'s very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the\\nfact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds -\\nis called a spanking.\\n>\\n>5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use?\\n     Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared\\na good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made\\nsure they didn\\'t play together for 5 days so he\\'d know that would make him\\nlose friends very quickly.  He\\'s never done anything like that since.\\n     We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don\\'t keep\\narguing with me over leaving, since it\\'s hard to argue with a macine.\\nI will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won\\'t be over until they\\ncalm down if they\\'re too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they\\'re\\nreally young.\\n\\n>6.  Your age?\\n     40\\n\\n>7.  Your location\\n     Bath, Ohio.  It\\'s right outside of Akron, in the northeast part of Ohio.\\n\\n>8.  While under the age of 16 did you ever commit a criminal\\n>offence?\\n     No, and none of my kids would dream of it.  I hope you can use this to\\nteach all parents that physical punishment isn\\'t always required - parents use\\nthat as an excuse to hit too hard.\\n\\n>9.  How ere you disciplined as a kid\\n     Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband\\'s have never\\nused spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they\\nwere almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And,\\nnone of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God\\'s law.\\n     Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that \"what\\nye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.\"  The Bible also says in all\\nthings to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.)\\nThere is no room for selfish anger, which I\\'ll admit I\\'ve been tempted with\\nat times.  When I\\'ve felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved\\na little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the\\ndevil\\'s work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid\\nto his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God\\'s\\nforgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that\\nwhat I had done was enough punishment.\\n-- \\nDoug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: \"Mommys and Daddys & other\\n    Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love\\nmissed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, \\'cause Heaven is just a great\\nhe ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!\"\\n',\n",

I know\\n>that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet\\n>hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying\\' You fools,\\n>do you still think that just believing is enough?\\'\\n\\nActually I don\\'t think there is any conflict if we really understand\\nwhat these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the \\nmeaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will\\ncome to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere \\nbelief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your \\nbelief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this \\nis what James means when he says that \"faith without works is dead\" \\nand, \"I will show you my faith by my works.\"  Remember James was \\nwriting to \"the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.\"  This \\nprobably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much \\nlater and wouldn\\'t understand the meaning of the original Greek.\\n(Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he\\nintended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the\\npeople of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of\\nthe Greek.\\n\\nAnother key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul\\'s\\nstatements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul\\ncontrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the\\ngospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great\\nburden of Paul\\'s life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go\\nconvert a bunch of people, then the \"Judizers\" would come along and\\ntry to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf\\nActs chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being\\nsaved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood\\nof Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation\\nfor today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think\\n\"faithfulness\" today has a meaning closer to what the original\\nwriters intended.\\n\\n>Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves\\n>and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.\\n\\nI think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is\\nthat God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not \"keep kosher\" to a\\nkosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters\\nof following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.\\n\\n>But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to\\n>him (i.e. doesn\\'t know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who\\n>knows and believes in God but doesn\\'t make any attempt to live by the bible.\\n\\nIn the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and \\nbe lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are \\nworse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in\\nthe parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in\\nthe one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that\\nthe price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.\\n\\n[I agree with you in general, including the fact that \"pistis\" has\\nsome of the force of \"faithful\".  However if you take that too far,\\nyou can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have\\nintended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say\\nthat we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we\\nare saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that\\'s not what you meant.\\n\\nI have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that\\ncompletely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I\\'d\\ncall a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and\\ncommitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic\\nchange.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show\\nthe new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any\\nChristian there had better be the basic change in orientation that\\nJesus calls being born again.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

His explaination was that \\nwhile it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence\\nof a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the \\nChurch as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church \\nrecoginizes itself as a community of believers, members\\nof the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable\\nto each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical\\ncouple on the desert island, there are many places in the\\nworld that do not have priests availible for marriages\\non a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without\\nthe priest being present, but get the priest to testify to\\ntheir marriage when one comes through the area.  \\n\\n\\tI remember a religion teacher in high school saying\\nthat the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple\\nas much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus,\\nmarried couples have some responsibility to the community\\nto stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the\\ncommunity.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with\\none another--the community should be able to rely on that \\ncouple to be as one.\\n\\n\\tWhile couples may marry without witnesses, they \\nmay NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An \\nanulment is simply an admission of the church that what\\nthey had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage\\nat all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married\\nin the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves\\nanulments a half-hour later!!\\n\\n\\tI tend to agree with the response back there that\\nsaid couples become married as soon as they consumate their\\nmarriage, but I would add that couples should consider their\\nmarriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they\\nintended to be married, assuming they were both willing\\npartners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared\\nto raise any children they may have as a result of that\\nsexual act with the benefit of both parents.

Smith, D.D.\\n                              (1894-1977)\\n\\n          When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about\\n     Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:\\n\\n                 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son\\n               of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief\\n               priests and unto the scribes, and they shall\\n               condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him\\n               to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and\\n               to crucify Him; and the third day He shall\\n               rise again\" (Matthew 20:18-19).\\n\\n          Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus,\\n     who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving\\n     reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He\\n     knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious\\n     leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that\\n     one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual\\n     death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly\\n     how He would die--*by crucifixion.*\\n\\n          All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the\\n     minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted\\n     would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise\\n     again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.\\n\\n          But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec-\\n     tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris-\\n     tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.\\n\\n          The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth\\n     between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and\\n     ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which\\n     had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against\\n     the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had\\n     predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and\\n     on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the\\n     disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some\\n     of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the\\n     tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment,\\n     they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back\\n     to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus\\' friends, Peter and\\n     John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the\\n     tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came\\n     hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them\\n     to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).\\n\\n          How did this tomb become empty?\\n\\n          One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America--\\n     professor of New Testament literature in a large theological\\n     seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how*\\n     the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by\\n     bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb\\n     became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the\\n     chimney at Christmas time.\\n\\n          But he didn\\'t realize that Santa Clause never did come down\\n     any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa\\n     Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the\\n     tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.\\n\\n          Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi-\\n     bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by\\n     mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.\\n\\n          Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University,\\n     tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar\\n     in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt)\\n     that the women went to the wrong tomb.\\n\\n          The facts are these:\\n\\n          First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to\\n     which by mistake they could have gone.\\n\\n          Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or\\n     more people to forget the place where they have buried their\\n     dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women\\n     did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to\\n     the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?\\n\\n          There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the\\n     evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.\\n\\n                  Now when they were going, behold, some\\n               of the watch came into the city and showed\\n               unto the chief priests all the things that\\n               were done.  And when they were assembled\\n               with the leaders and had taken counsel, they\\n               gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying,\\n               Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole\\n               Him away while we slept.  And if this come to\\n               the governor\\'s ears, we will persuade him, and\\n               secure you.  So they took the money, and did\\n               as they were taught:  and this saying is com-\\n               monly reported among the Jews until this day\\n               (Matthew 28:11-15).\\n\\n          This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the\\n     fact that the tomb was empty.\\n\\n          You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never\\n     questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to\\n     see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.\\n\\n          Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that\\n     the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus\\' disciples\\n     came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*\\n\\n          How could they know what was going on while they were asleep?\\n     Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.\\n\\n          Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject\\n     the explanation, the very character and the later history of the\\n     disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away\\n     the body of Jesus.\\n\\n          First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in\\n     Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to\\n     contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His\\n     resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there\\n     had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected,\\n     then proved.\\n\\n          Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would\\n     have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent.\\n     It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most\\n     of these men did.\\n\\n          The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ\\n     had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it\\n     would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed\\n     pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing\\n     humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today\\n     as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.\\n\\n          But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to\\n     leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to\\n     what had happened to Him.\\n\\n          Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.\\n\\n          He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning\\n     (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11-\\n     18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He\\n     walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that\\n     night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper\\n     room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).\\n\\n          A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at\\n     the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren\\n     on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the\\n     apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3-\\n     8).\\n\\n          As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor-\\n     ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed\\n     attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are\\n     unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the\\n     unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the\\n     appearances.\\n\\n          Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our\\n     leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are\\n     antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest\\n     thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle.\\n     Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale;\\n     Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of\\n     Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president\\n     of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.\\n\\n          But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has\\n     it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this:\\n     it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.\\n\\n          Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He\\n     claimed to have come down *from* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the way *to* God.\\n\\n          He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.\\n\\n          He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one\\n     else had it.\\n\\n          He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to\\n     us.\\n\\n          Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed\\n     that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*\\n\\n          Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe\\n     that His words are all true?\\n\\n          The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us\\n     that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?\\n\\n          And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead\\n     testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some\\n     day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.\\n\\n          In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all\\n     this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For\\n     He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan-\\n     ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a\\n     hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.\\n\\n          Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been\\n     many*--have given their testimony.

Everyone,\\n\\nBecause no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess\\nmy question was not so clear. Now I\\'d like to describe it in detail:\\n\\nThe offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which\\nrolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse\\nand its offset is same everywhere.\\n\\nThis problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.\\nThe tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the\\npositions of the ball\\'s center. Is the offset of an ellipse still\\nan ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial\\nStandard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was\\nimplemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold\\ninternationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!\\nHow many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most\\nimportantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?\\n\\nI was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year\\nto specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this\\nproblem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)\\nis not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire\\nor half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from\\na quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not\\nanalytical. I am now wondering if I didn\\'t touch the base and make things\\ncomplicated. Please give me a hint.\\n\\nI know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.\\nHowever, so many people involved in the problem \"sphere from 4 poits\".\\nWhy not an ellipse? And why not its offset?\\n\\nPlease post here and let the others share our interests \\n(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the\\nsummary of the answers).\\n\\nYeh\\nUSC\\n',\n",

Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for\\nthe prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the\\ncommands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus.\\nAs it says in 1 John 5:3:  \"This is love for God:  to obey his comands.\"\\nThat obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this\\nrequires work on our part.\\n\\nAs for the quote in James, Satan doesn\\'t care what we believe.  What\\nmatters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in\\nwhat one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to\\noneself about believing in the first place.  \\n\\nStan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by\\nobligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how\\nmany times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when\\ndoing God\\'s work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we\\nshould do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel\\nJesus\\' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to\\nTimothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  \"Preach the Word; be prepared in season and\\nout of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and\\ncareful instruction.\"  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1\\nTimothy 4:16:  \"Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in\\nthem, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers.\"\\nSo, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are\\ncorrect first.  Remember Jesus\\' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be\\nhypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be\\na disciple completely in both thought and deed.  \\n\\nJoe Fisher\\n \\n',\n",

We use it to\\nproduce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local\\nnetwork.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the\\nimage quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the\\nvideo to the Net.\\n\\nWe also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for\\nuse by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for\\ncommercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.\\n\\nThe Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll\\ndigitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as\\nan inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker\\nof the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been\\nunable to deliver.  Our system produces \"near VHS\" quality at 30 fields per\\nsecond (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60\\nfields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some\\nfind distracting.\\n\\nIf you can get past this problem, you\\'ll find the Adobe Premier editing \\nsoftware quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of\\ndifferent effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.\\n\\nBecause of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you\\'ve ever\\nused (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you\\'ll recognize the methodology\\nand the user interface.\\n\\nThe total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21\" Apple mon-\\nitor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),\\nComposite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.\\n\\nFor you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality\\nthat will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more\\neffects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system\\nwill look better.\\n\\nWe use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.

       "  'From: jemurray@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (John E Murray)\\nSubject: quality of Catholic liturgy\\nOrganization: The Ohio State University\\nLines: 37\\n\\nI would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my\\nwife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few\\nyears it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It\\'s\\ndriving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is\\nthat what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to \\ndo it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we \\npresent to God.  But the best Masses I\\'ve been to were participatory prayers.\\n\\nLately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion\\nof sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do\\n(which is necessary because no one knows what\\'s happening next) is growing.\\nExample.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually\\non Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking\\nthe role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say\\n\"Crucify him\" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we\\'d do it\\nagain.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were \"invited\" to sit\\nduring the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian \"invitation\", \\nI was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems\\ntypical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the\\nmusicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the\\nliturgy and since no one knows what\\'s happening, the new things have to be\\nexplained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we\\'re just\\nsitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about\\nto be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay\\n\"experts\", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a\\nbias toward doing something rather than nothing--that\\'s just a fact of\\nbureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for\\npeople to be aware of the Lord\\'s presence.\\n\\nSo we\\'ve been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass\\ngoing down?  I don\\'t mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or\\nFriday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware \\nof God\\'s presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should \\njust offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational\\nparticipation in Catholic Masses lately?\\n\\nJohn Murray\\n',\n",

Reproduced without permission.]\\n\\n\\n\\nDigression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors\\n\\nAlthough the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically\\ntasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle\\nberries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in\\nsuch a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, \\nMoskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle\\nberry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids \\n(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste\\nsour as well.\\n\\nMiraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a\\ndiet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin\\npill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such\\nsubstances would taste sweet without providing many calories.\\n\\nA colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.\\nWe drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted\\nextremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We \\nawoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.\\n\\n[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]\\n\\n\\nRefs:  \\n\\nBartoshuk, L.M., Gentile, R.L., Moskowitz, H.R., & Meiselman, H.L.

That is, when you tell us murder\\n>is wrong, you are using a term you have not yet defined.\\n\\nWell, I\\'ve said that when an innocent person has been executed, this is\\nobjectively a murder.  However, who is at blame is another question.\\nIt seems that the entire society that sanctions any sorts of executions--\\nrealizing the risks--is to blame.\\n\\n>There is a *probability* of \\n>killing an innocent person by shooting at random into the air, and \\n>there is a *probability* of killing an innocent person when the\\n>state administers a system of capital punishment.  So when you do\\n>either, you know that they actions you are taking will sooner or \\n>later result in the killing of an innocent person.\\n\\nYes, but there is also a probablity that you will kill someone doing\\nany raondom activity.  Presumably, you had not isolated yourself totally\\nfrom the rest of society because of this.\\n\\n>>And, driving will kill people, as will airlines, but people continue to do\\n>>both.\\n>Driving and flying are not punishments inflicted on unwilling\\n>prisoners by Courts.  They are risks that we take upon ourselves\\n>willingly.\\n\\nAnd I argue that our law system is a similar risk.  Perhaps an innocent\\nperson will be punished someday, but we work to prevent this.  In fact,\\nmany criminals go free as a result of our trying to prevent punishment\\nof innocents.\\n\\n>If our own driving kills someone else, then sure, there is a moral\\n>issue.  I know at least one person who was involved in a fatal\\n>accident, and they felt vey guilty afterwards.\\n\\nBut, such accidents are to be totally expected, given the numner of vehicals\\non the road.  Again, the blame is on society.\\n\\n>>No I\\'m not.  This is what you said.  You were saying that if there were such\\n>>a false witness that resulted in an innocent person being convicted and killed\\n>>, it would still be the fault of the state, since it did the actual killing.\\n>No, I just commented that the state does the killing.  It does not\\n>depend on there being false witnesses.  How could it?  The state\\n>does the killing even in the case of sincere mistakes\\n\\nYes, but the state is not at fault in such a case.  The state can only do\\nso much to prevent false witnesses.\\n\\n>>It is possible.  So, what are you trying to say, that capital punishment\\n>>is always murder because of the possibilty of human error invalidating\\n>>the system?\\n>I\\'m saying capital punishment is murder, period.  Not because of\\n>this that and the other, but because it involves taking human life.\\n>That\\'s *my* definition of murder.  I make no appeals to dictionaries\\n>or to \"objective\" morals.\\n\\nOkay, so this is what you call murder.  But, the question is whether or not\\nall such \"murders\" are wrong.  Are you saying that all taking of human life\\nis wrong, no matter what the circumstances?\\n\\n>If we, as a society, decide to murder someone, then we should say\\n>that, and lists our reasons for doing so, and live with the moral\\n>consequences.  We should not play word games and pretend that\\n>murder isn\\'t murder.  And that\\'s *my* opinion about how society\\n>ought to be run.\\n\\nBut, this is basically how it works.  Society accepts the risk that an\\ninnocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of\\nsociety shares this blame.  And, most people\\'s definitions of murder\\ninclude some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an\\nexecution, is it?\\n\\n>>But, we were trying to discuss an objective moral system, or at least its\\n>>possibilty.  What ramifications does your personal system have on an\\n>>objective one?\\n>No, we were not discussing an objective moral system.  I was showing\\n>you that you didn\\'t have one, because, for one thing, you were incapable\\n>of defining the terms in it, for example, \"murder\".\\n\\nMurder violates the golden rule.  Executions do not, because by allowing\\nit at all, society implicitly accepts the consequences no matter who the\\ninnocent victim is.\\n\\n>>We\\'re not talking about reading minds, we are just talking about knowing the\\n>>truth.  Yes, we can never be absolutely certain that we have the truth, but\\n>>the court systems work on a principle of knowing the \"truth\" \"beyond a\\n>>reasonable doubt.\"  \\n>Sorry, but you simply are not quoting yourself accurately.

The jury being *persuaded* beyond a serious\\n>doubt is not the same as us knowing what is in their minds beyond\\n>a serious doubt.\\n\\nReading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction\\nwas moral or not.  But, in an objective system, only the absolute truth\\nmatters, and the jury system is one method to approximate such a truth.  That\\nis, twelve members must be convinced of a truth.\\n\\n>Moreover, a jury which comes from a sufficiently prejudiced background\\n>may allow itself to be persuaded beyond a serious doubt on evidence\\n>that you and I would laugh at.\\n\\nBut then, if we read the minds of these people, we would know that the\\nconviction was unfair.\\n\\n>>But, would it be perfectly fair if we could read minds?  If we assume that\\n>>it would be fair if we knew the absolute truth, why is it so much less\\n>>fair, in your opinion, if we only have a good approximation of the absolute\\n>>truth?\\n>It\\'s not a question of fairness.  Your claim, which I have quoted\\n>above is a claim about whether we can *know* it was fair, so as to\\n>be able to distinguish capital punishnment from murder.\\n\\nYes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all\\npossible information), we can\\'t always determine the difference in our\\nflawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible,\\nbut it still isn\\'t objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn\\'t matter if\\nwe *know* it is fair or not.  Objectively, it is either fair or it is not.\\n\\n>Now there\\'s a huge difference.  If we can read minds, we can know,\\n>and if we cannot read minds, we can know nothing.  The difference\\n>is not in degree of fairness, but in what we can know.\\n\\nBut what we know has no effect on an objective system.\\n\\n>>I think it is possible to produce a fairly objective system, if we are\\n>>clear on which goals it is supposed to promote.\\n>I\\'m not going to waste my time trying to devise a system that I am\\n>pretty sure does not exist.\\n\\nWhy are you so sure?\\n\\n>I simply want people to confront reality.  *My* reality, remember.\\n\\nWhy is *your* reality important?\\n\\n>In this case, the reality is that, \"ideal theories\\' apart, we can\\n>never know, even after the fact, about the fairness of the justice\\n>system.  For every innocent person released from Death Row, there\\n>may have been a dozen innocent people executed, or a hundred, or\\n>none at all.  We simply don\\'t know.\\n\\nBut, we can assume that the system is fairly decent, at least most likely.\\nAnd, you realize that the correctness of our system says nothing about a\\ntotally ideal and objective system.\\n\\n>Now what are we going to do?  On the one hand, we can pretend\\n>that we have an \\'ideal\\' theory, and that we can know things we can\\n>never know, and the Justie System is fair, and that we can wave a \\n>magic wand and make certain types of killing not murder, and go \\n>on our way.\\n\\nWell, we can have an ideal system, but the working system can not be ideal.\\nWe can only hope to create a system that is as close an approximation to\\nthe ideal system as possible.\\n\\n>On the other hand, we can recognize that all Justice has a small\\n>- we hope - probability of punishing the innocent, and that in the\\n>end we do bear moral responsibility even for the probabilistic\\n>consequences of the systems we set up, and then say, \"Well, here\\n>we go, murdering again.\"  Maybe some of us will even say \"Gee, I\\n>wonder if all this is strictly necessary?\"\\n\\nYes, we all bear the responsibility.  Most people seem willing to do this.\\n\\n>I think that the second is preferable in that if requires people\\n>to face the moral consequences of what we do as a society, instead\\n>of sheltering ourselves from them by magic ceremonies and word \\n>games.\\n\\nWe must realize the consequences of all our actions.

Paul thought it was.  Paul said, \\n\"Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.\"\\n\\nToday, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of\\nit is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don\\'t tell people anymore, that\\nthere\\'s such a thing as sin or that there\\'s such a place as hell.  \\n\\nAs Jayne has said, this doesn\\'t mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit\\npeople over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a\\nplace called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to\\nexperience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we\\ncan to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going\\nto \"outer darkness.\".  \\n\\nJesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn\\'t prepare hell for people.  He prepared\\nit for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere,\\nthat God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the\\nelect are the \"whosoever will\" and the nonelect are the \"whosoever wont\\'s.\" \\nWhether or not that\\'s theologically sound, I couldn\\'t defend, but its\\npractical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, \"Ye would not.\"  \\n\\nNow, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be\\nChristians.  Have you ever said to somebody, \"I don\\'t believe in hell.  I\\nbelieve in the religion of Jesus.\"  But did you know that Jesus talked more\\nabout hell than He did about heaven!  \"Oh I believe in the religion of the\\nsermon on the mount.\"  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the\\nmount.  You\\'ll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. \\nSeveral times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over\\nin the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. \\nNot Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. \\nThe great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn\\'t\\nwant to see them go there.\\n\\nNow, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus,\\nnot some angry Baptist preacher, that said, \"where the worm never dies, and\\nwhere the fire never goes out.\"  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell\\na \"furnace of fire.\"  It was Jesus that used the word, \"condemnation.\"  \"And\\nthis is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because\\ntheir deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  \\n\\nHow can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell?\\n Not only that, but He went through hell.  That\\'s what Calgary was all about. \\nWhen my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, \"outer\\ndarkness.\"  \\n\\nDo you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over\\nhere, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are\\nprostituting their bodies over there?  That\\'s not what hell is.  Hell\\'s not a\\nparty.  There\\'s no fellowship there.  He called it \"outer darkness.\"  \"Outer\"\\n-away from God.  \"Darkness\" -God is light.  \\n\\nNo when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated\\nJesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That\\'s is a sobering thought.  As my\\nson would say, an \"awesome\" thought.  \\n\\n\"My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?\"  Hell is isolation.  There\\'s no\\nfellowship in hell.  There\\'s no friendship in hell.  There\\'s no loving embrace\\nin hell.  There\\'s no hand shake in hell.  There\\'s no word of encouragement in\\nhell.  \\n\\n\"I thirst.\"  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving\\nwith no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it\\neternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman\\'s body, will\\ncrave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way\\nand I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of\\nenvironment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  \\n\\nIn a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life\\nministries.  I\\'ve remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the\\nillustration that I gave wasn\\'t his.  His illustration was that he was talking\\nto his barber and his barber\\'s wife and daughter had just recently been saved\\nand he was commenting about it to Jack.  \"They sing these songs and read Bible\\nverses, and their praising this and that -I can\\'t stand it!  Jack, do you think\\nGod would send me to hell?\"  Jack answered by saying, \"Yes I think he would!\" \\nOf course the barber said, \"What do you mean by that.\"  \"Well if you can\\'t\\nstand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to\\nGod now, what would you do in heaven where they\\'ll do it for eternity?  You\\'d\\nbe miserable.  Because God loves you, He\\'d put you where it would match what\\nyou really are.\"   It makes a man think.\\n\\nThe crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal\\nexistence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don\\'t ask\\nme how, I don\\'t know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He\\ndied, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He\\npurchased eternal life for the \"whosoever wills.\"  He suffered eternal\\njudgment.  \\n\\nA lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying \"Everybody is going\\nto be saved eventually.\"  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He\\'ll separate\\nthem.  The sheep from the goats.  \".After you die there\\'s a probationary period\\nin which God prepares you for heaven.\"  No, my Bible says that \"It is appointed\\nunto men once to die and then comes judgment.\"  Some of the cultist believe in\\nannihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you\\'re squished\\nout.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as\\nthere is in heaven.  \\n\\nI don\\'t enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don\\'t enjoy\\nlistening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a\\nplace called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any\\nhope that people aren\\'t going there, I\\'d give it to you, but I haven\\'t found\\nit.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a\\nGod of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of\\ncreatures we are and therefore we\\'re responsible, the fact that He has placed\\nus in a \"uni\"verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is\\nsuch an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us\\nfrom hell leads us to two applications.\\n\\n1)  As I\\'ve already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. \\nIts not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just\\naround the bend the bridge is out.  \"Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we\\npersuade men.\"\\n\\n2)  If you haven\\'t accepted Jesus are your Savior, you\\'re taking an awful\\nchance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if\\nyou are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die\\nand cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and\\nsuffer eternal damnation.  I don\\'t mean to make fun at this point, but its like\\nDirty Harry said, \"You\\'ve got to ask yourself, \\'Do I feel lucky?\\'  Well do\\nyou?\"  \"A man\\'s got to know his limitations.\"  Don\\'t be one of the \"whosoever\\nwont\\'s.\"  \\n\\n\"Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me.\"\\n\"There\\'s no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another.\"\\n--Rex\\n \\n',\n",

An example of the type of thing is in Col  \\n3:22-23 where bondservants were to \"work heartily as unto the Lord\" - so  \\nalso we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. \"Pressed down, shaken  \\ntogether, and running over\"... oops - a bit of a side track there...\\n\\nIn the contests between the nations, we are on God\\'s side - a side that is  \\nnot fighting in the battle, but is \"testifying\" to the truth.\\n\\nWhen we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become \"fellow  \\ncitizens with the Saints and of the Household of God\", and are no longer  \\ninterested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to  \\nunions etc as well. Paul tells us to \"lay aside every weight\" that we may  \\nrun \"the race that is set before us\", and if we are wise, we will discard  \\nany association which would retard our progress - \"Thou therefore endure  \\nhardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth  \\nhimself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath  \\nchosen him to be a soldier\" (2 Tim 2:3-4).\\n\\nOne of these entanglements he warns about is \"be ye not unequally yoked  \\ntogether with unbelievers\". One of the obvious applications of this is  \\nmarriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business  \\npartnerships and any other position where we may form a close association  \\nwith any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case  \\nthe army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as  \\nthem being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one  \\nunclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18  \\n- I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of  \\nservitude, and Jesus says \"take my yoke upon you\", so we are then yoked  \\nwith Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen  \\nthat we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says \"become not ye the  \\nbondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).\\n\\nAn example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2  \\n\"Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?\". The situation here is a good  \\nexample of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers.  \\nJehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts:\\n1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had \"sold himself to work  \\nwickedness before the Lord\" (1 Kings 21:25).\\n2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said  \\n\"I am as thou art, my people as thy people\" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal  \\nyoking.\\n3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted  \\non hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he  \\nfound that he was yoked and therefore couldn\\'t break away from the evil  \\nassociation he had made.\\n\\nGod says to us \"Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not  \\nthe unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and  \\ndaughters\" (2 Cor 6:17).\\n\\nThis is more or less what I have found out so far - I\\'m still looking into  \\nit, as I don\\'t think I\\'ve answered all the questions raised by Alastair  \\nyet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:\\n\\nThe Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential  \\nfactor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).\\n\\nTotal dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).\\n\\nDisobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his  \\nfollowers (1 Pet 2:7-8).\\n\\nWe are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant  \\nrelationship (Rom 6:12,16).\\n\\nNo man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).\\n\\nAll that is in the \\'Kosmos\\' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1  \\nJohn 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in  \\nnature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is  \\nour master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom  \\nwas not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another  \\nmaster.\\n\\nStrangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to  \\nanyone but God.\\n\\nThe servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) -  \\nthis does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout  \\nour lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man\\'s weapons (2 Cor  \\n10:3-4), but with God\\'s armour (Eph6:13-20).\\n\\nI\\'ll probably post some more when I\\'ve had time to look into things a bit  \\nfurther.\\n\\n--\\nGideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347\\nUniversity of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529\\nDepartment of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nz\\nP.O.

Spoofing a keyboard over the serial port\\n\\n\\tIf you\\'ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard\\n\\t(Sun, HP, DEC, etc.) then you\\'re going to have a hard time finding\\n\\ta vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard.  If your workstation\\n\\truns the X window system, you\\'re in luck.  You can buy a cheap used\\n\\tPC, hook your expensive keyboard up to it, and run a serial cable\\n\\tto your workstation.  Then, run a program on the workstation to read\\n\\tthe serial port and generate fake X keyboard events.\\n\\n\\tThe two main programs I\\'ve found to do this are KT and A2X.\\n\\n\\ta2x is a sophisticated program, capable of controlling the mouse, and\\n\\teven moving among widgets on the screen.  It requires a server\\n\\textension (XTEST, DEC-XTRAP, or XTestExtension1).  To find out if your\\n\\tserver can do this, run \\'xdpyinfo\\' and see if any of these strings\\n\\tappear in the extensions list.  If your server doesn\\'t have this,\\n\\tyou may want to investigate compiling X11R5, patchlevel 18 or later,\\n\\tor bugging your vendor.\\n\\n\\tkt is a simpler program, which should work with unextended X servers.\\n\\tAnother program called xsendevent also exists, but I haven\\'t seen it.\\n\\n\\tBoth a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n    2. X terminals\\n\\n\\tAlso, a number of X terminals (NCD, Tektronics, to name a few) use\\n\\tPC-compatible keyboards.  If you have an X terminal, you may be all\\n\\tset.  Try it out with a normal PC keyboard before you go through the\\n\\ttrouble of buying an alternative keyboard.

NeXT\\n\\n\\tNeXT had announced that new NeXT machines will use the Apple Desktop\\n\\tBus, meaning any Mac keyboard will work.  Then, they announced they\\n\\twere cancelling their hardware production.  If you want any kind of\\n\\tupgrade for an older NeXT, do it now!\\n\\n    4. Silicon Graphics\\n\\n\\tSilicon Graphics has announced that their newer machines (Indigo^2 and\\n\\tbeyond) will use standard PC-compatible keyboards and mice.  I don\\'t\\n\\tbelieve this also applies to the Power Series machines.  It\\'s not\\n\\tpossible to upgrade an older SGI to use PC keyboards, except by\\n\\tupgrading the entire machine.  Contact your SGI sales rep for more\\n\\tdetails.\\n\\n    5. IBM RS/6000\\n\\n\\tIBM RS/6000 keyboards are actually similar to normal PC keyboards.  ||\\n\\tUnfortunately, you can\\'t just plug one in.  You need two things: a  ||\\n\\tcable converter to go from the large PC keyboard connector to the   ||\\n\\tsmaller PS/2 style DIN-6, and a new device driver for AIX.  Believe ||\\n\\tit or not, IBM wrote this device driver recently, I used it, and it ||\\n\\tworks.  However, they don\\'t want me to redistribute it.  I\\'ve been  ||\\n\\ttold Judy Hume (512) 823-6337 is a potential contact.  If you learn ||\\n\\tanything new, please send me e-mail.\\t\\t\\t\\t    ||\\n    \\n    6.

My comments are based\\nprimarily on William Rusch\\'s historical summary in \"The Trinitarian\\nControversy\", Fortress.  I\\'m going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]\\n\\nMAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY\\n \\n[SECOND CENTURY\\n\\nThe writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much\\nof the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides,\\nAthenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the\\n\"Apologists\".  Their theology has often been described as \"Logos\\ntheology\".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less\\na two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the\\nFather, as his mind or thought.  This \"immanent Word\" became\\n\"expressed\" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus.\\nThus Jesus\\' full distinction from the Father only became visible in\\nhistory, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity.\\nRusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the\\nfinal orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated,\\nbecause it did not have the technical language to properly deal with\\nthe eternal plurality in the Godhead.\\n\\nIrenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he\\nwas uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as\\none personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible\\nexcept through his process of self-revelation (the \"economy\").  The\\ndistinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized\\nthe Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus\\' views should\\nprobably be called \"economic trinitarianism\", though that term is\\nnormally used (as below) to refer to later developments.\\n\\n\\nTHIRD CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nDynamic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Theodotus\\nAdherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature\\nand oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are\\nconsubstantial with the Father\\'s divine essence only as impersonal attributes.\\nThe divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict\\nsense of the word.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable\\nimpossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The\\n\\'diversity\\' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the\\nwork of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to\\na hypostatic union.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and\\nwithout beginning or end.\\n Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in\\na unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified.\\n Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality\\nis ascribed to the Holy Spirit.\\nCriticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation\\nconcerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the\\nHoly Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical\\ndoctrine of salvation.\\n[In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism\\nat all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen\\nas simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the\\nChurch.  --clh]\\n\\n \\nModalistic Monarchianism\\n \\nSource: Praxeas\\nAdherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals\\n(Jesus Only)\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is\\nqualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This\\nessence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.\\nThey are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The\\nthree names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous\\nand confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God\\'s modalistic manifesting\\nof himself. The paradox of a subsisting \"three in oneness\" is refuted by\\nrecognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different\\nnames and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of\\nthe only unique and unitary God\\n Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another\\nmode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God\\nmanifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation).\\n Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the\\none God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of\\nregeneration and sanctification.\\nCriticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian\\ndeficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its\\nconcept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such\\nsimultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ\\'s baptism.\\n[Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are\\nactually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his\\nfollowers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme.\\nSabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic\\nTrinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately,\\ninformation about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there\\nseems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]\\n \\n[I\\'ve moved the following description to be with the other\\nthird-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]\\n\\n\"Economic\" Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Hippolytus, Tertullian\\nAdherents: Various \"neo-economic\" Trinitarians\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father,\\nSon, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical,\\nindivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially\\ncomprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated\\nby means of such terms as \"distinction\" and \"distribution\" dispelling\\neffectively the notion of separateness or division.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nThe equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in\\nobservation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the\\nGodhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this\\nambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication.\\nCriticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the\\nrelational aspect of the Trinity.\\n[Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as\\nmentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in\\nthe various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they\\ndid say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow\\npresent in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of\\nthe Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in\\nsubstance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially\\northodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]\\n\\n[Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted\\nto apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms\\nof the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a\\nmediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality\\nof creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is \"eternally\\ngenerated\".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is\\neternal.  It cannot be said that \"there was once when he was not\" (a\\nphrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son\\nis intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described\\nas separate \"hypostases\", though this may not have quite the meaning\\nof separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is\\none of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may\\nhave used the term homoousios (\"of the same substance\").  The Holy\\nSpirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father\\nthrough the Son.  Origen\\'s intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but\\nhe pushes things in the direction of separateness.\\n\\n\\nFOURTH CENTURY\\n\\n--clh]\\n\\nSubordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]\\n \\nSource: Arius\\nMajor Adherents: Modern Jehovah\\'s Witnesses, and several other lesser known\\ncults\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: The inherent oneness of God\\'s nature is properly\\nidentifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet\\nentities who do not share the divine essence.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the\\nconcept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. \"Threeness in oneness\" is self-\\ncontradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\n Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning.\\n Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated,\\nhe is not of the divine essence.\\n Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed\\nas an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him.\\nCriticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting\\nthe deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise\\nasserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ,\\nand the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology.\\n[Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully\\nhuman either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this\\nview from adoptionism.  --clh]\\n \\nOrthodox Trinitarianism\\n \\nSource: Athanasius\\nAdherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas\\nAquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity\\nPerception of God\\'s Essence: God\\'s being is perfectly unified and simplex: of\\none essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy\\nSpirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co-\\neternal.\\nPerception of God\\'s Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in\\nthree modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists \"undivided in\\ndivided persons.\" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation\\nin function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead.\\nAsignation of Deity/Eternality:\\nIn its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son,\\nand Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both\\nthe divine essence and function.\\nCriticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in\\nhuman language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the\\nineffable mystery of \"three in oneness.\"\\n[At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all\\nof which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which\\nare somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond\\nto Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen\\'s thought a bit\\ntoo far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general\\nthe East tended to take an approach based on Origen\\'s, and it was hard\\nto get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was\\nbased on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and\\nGregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three,\\nthey show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one\\nmust think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council\\nof Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of\\nthree hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]\\n\\nAdapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

Can do simple display,\\n  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS\\n  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions\\n  [PC and Macs]\\n\\nLabVIEW 2\\n---------\\n  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe\\n  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,\\n  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,\\n  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..\\n\\n  Adobe Systems, Inc. 1585 Charlestown Road PO Box 7900 Mountain View, CA\\n  94039-7900 415-961-4400\\n\\nColorStudio and ImageStudio\\n---------------------------\\n  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has\\n  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and\\n  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of\\nreligion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a \"real\"\\nstory (that is, a bigger headline).\\n\\nLet\\'s back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the\\nvarious targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the\\nSeptuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the\\nstandard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has\\nobvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy.\\nThese passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and\\nto the Septuagint.\\n\\nNow, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars:\\nfirst, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are\\nvariant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to \"fixing\"/predating\\nthe various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of\\nmy knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and\\nhave little theological import.\\n\\nThe dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of\\nIsaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There\\nis also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no\\nsign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the\\nseptuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations\\nbetween the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the\\nseptuagint, where the latter isn\\'t obviously in error.  Again, though, the\\ndifferences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big\\nexpectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the\\nmaterial, but so far this hasn\\'t happened.\\n\\nThe DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the\\nOT, unlike for the NT.\\n-- \\nC.

Why he talks about those things\\nis because they are now \"obvious\" to him.  What is \"obvious\" to him is\\nnot obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because\\nfrom his point of view, he has been on \"both sides of the fence\".  This\\nI mean that before he turned \"fundamentalist\", you two are agreeable\\nbecause both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if\\na new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the\\ndiscovery of let\\'s say a new continent, or a new planet.

However,\\nI do understand how you feel too, because I wasn\\'t a Christian for a good\\npart of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or\\n\"fundamentalists\" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their\\nfaith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately,\\n\"religious belief\" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism\\nis also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is\\ninevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise),\\nit will be a touchy matter.

Don\\'t tell him it\\'s nonsense, because to him it is reality -\\nand that would be a real insult.  He\\'ll also have to be careful not to\\ninsult where you stand too.\\n\\nLike I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too.\\nI\\'ll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a\\nChristian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little\\ndifferently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited\\nand just blabbered away about what I\\'ve found!

You will probably think he\\'s crazy too -\\nbut God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in\\nmind.

The  Bible\\n   makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal\\n   and consists of perpetual suffering.\\n \\n      And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was\\n      cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15\\n \\n      So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come\\n      forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall\\n      cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and\\n      gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50\\n \\n      ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with\\n      his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them\\n      that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\\n      Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting\\n      destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory\\n      of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9\\n \\n \\nQ. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?\\n \\nA. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be\\n   accountable to God for his actions.  God\\'s perfect  justice  demands\\n   payment for sin.\\n \\n      For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23\\n \\n      For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ;\\n      that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body,\\n      according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.\\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:10\\n \\n      But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,\\n      they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.\\n                                                       Matthew 12:36\\n \\n \\nQ. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought\\n   to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?\\n \\nA. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our\\n   substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our\\n   sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus\\n   Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.\\n \\n      All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one\\n      to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of\\n      us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6\\n \\n      But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for\\n      our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him;\\n      and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5\\n \\n      For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also\\n      received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the\\n      scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the\\n      third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4\\n \\n      For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that\\n      we might be made the righteousness of God in him.\\n                                                  2 Corinthians 5:21\\n \\n \\nQ. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was\\n   already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about\\n   Hell anymore?\\n \\nA. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it\\n   is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God.\\n   Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.\\n \\n      He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he\\n      that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath\\n      of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36\\n \\n \\nQ. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that\\n   the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to\\n   Hell?\\n \\nA. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our\\n   minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole\\n   lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to\\n   the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins\\n   and serve Christ as our Lord.\\n \\n      No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,\\n      and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and\\n      despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.\\n                                                        Matthew 6:24\\n \\n      Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be\\n      blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the\\n      presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19\\n \\n \\nQ. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except\\n   through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their\\n   followers also go to Hell?\\n \\nA. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account-\\n   able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other\\n   religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their\\n   followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and\\n   save us.\\n \\n      Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none\\n      other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be\\n      saved.                                               Acts 4:12\\n \\n   Jesus said:\\n \\n      I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the\\n      Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6\\n \\n      If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us\\n      our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.\\n                                                          1 John 1:9\\n \\n \\nQ. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?\\n \\nA. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You\\n   must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see\\n   your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.\\n \\n      And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much\\n      as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying,\\n      God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13\\n \\n      ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe\\n      on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ...\\n                                                       Acts 16:30-31\\n \\n \\nQ. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?\\n \\nA. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He\\n   also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that\\n   He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.\\n \\n      For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of\\n      yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8\\n \\n   God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So,\\n   if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you\\n   should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is\\n   the only Word of God.\\n   In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented\\n   paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.\\n \\n      So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of\\n      God.                                              Romans 10:17\\n \\n \\nQ. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?\\n \\nA. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging\\n   our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.\\n \\n      The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a\\n      contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17\\n \\n   Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin\\n   to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we\\n   sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins\\n   as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to\\n   Hell.\\n \\n      Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him\\n      to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his\\n      iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26\\n \\n \\nQ. Doesn\\'t  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be\\n   baptized?  Will these save me?\\n \\nA. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us.\\n   No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God\\'s\\n   sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas-\\n   ure.  Salvation is\\n \\n      Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9\\n \\n \\nQ. What else will happen at the end of the world?\\n \\nA. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed\\n   into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever-\\n   more.\\n \\n      For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout,\\n      with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God:\\n      and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are\\n      alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the\\n      clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be\\n      with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17\\n \\n \\nQ. What will happen to the earth at that time?\\n \\nA. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens\\n   and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever-\\n   more.\\n \\n      But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in\\n      the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and\\n      the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and\\n      the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ...\\n      Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new\\n      heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.\\n                                                     2 Peter 3:10,13\\n \\n \\nQ. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will\\n   come?\\n \\nA. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to\\n   save.\\n \\n      And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the\\n      world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end\\n      come.                                            Matthew 24:14\\n \\n \\nQ. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?\\n \\nA. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing\\n   of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the\\n   Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not\\n   come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the\\n   Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be\\n   very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.\\n \\n      For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden\\n      destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with\\n      child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3\\n \\n      Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his\\n      secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7\\n \\n \\nQ. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.\\n \\nA. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to\\n   destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.\\n \\n      And Jonah began to enter into the city a day\\'s journey, and he\\n      cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be\\n      overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4\\n \\n \\nQ. What did the people of Nineveh do?\\n \\nA. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented\\n   of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.\\n \\n      But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry\\n      mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil\\n      way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can\\n      tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his\\n      fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9\\n \\n \\nQ. Did God hear their prayers?\\n \\nA. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.\\n \\n \\nQ. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg-\\n   ment?\\n \\nA. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has\\n   become very short.\\n \\n      How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which\\n      at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed\\n      unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3\\n \\n      In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,\\n      and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye\\n      people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for\\n      us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n            A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?\\n \\n \\n \\nA  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical\\ninformation that we may be very near the end of time.

A  number  of  minor\\nchanges  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing\\nand  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph\\nwhich  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the\\ntext.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they\\nappear here as indented paragraphs.\\n \\n \\nI have read Mr. Camping\\'s book, compared it with what the Bible actual-\\nly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what\\nthe  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that\\nthere  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed\\none  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these\\nmatters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return,\\nit  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our\\neternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more\\nsenseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with\\nrespect  to life expectancy no longer applies.

To paraphrase Acts\\n20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I\\nam  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with\\nanyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any\\nreal  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little\\ntime  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

Biomedical research doesn\\'t make any basic \\nassumptions that aren\\'t the same as any other discipline of scientific\\nresearch.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis\\nand test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than \\n\"the old Newtonian model of the world\".  And I doubt that many psychologists\\nwould appreciate being put outside this empirical \"world view\".  Psychology\\nalso has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. \\n\\n>It is also important to distinguish reason from science.

Aristotle reasoned\\n>that frogs came from mud by observing one hop out of a puddle. \\n\\nOversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-\\ntion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually \\nfound wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will \\nhave continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  \\nThere\\'s nothing at all surprising about this, it\\'s the way the gathering of\\nknowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own \\ndiscipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,\\neven idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won\\'t have come\\nto these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had \\na vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and \\ntested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting\\nscience and research can\\'t seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a \\ncreative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally\\nturned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  \\n\\nAgain, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by \"science\".  I often\\ndon\\'t recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science\\nis portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They\\nportray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH\\nin big gold letters.  That\\'s silly.

Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with\\nhis wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined\\nslights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this\\'ll\\nhappen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I\\'ve\\nseen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep\\nthe next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact\\nwith us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his\\nchoice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it\\'s hard.\\n   From time to time I\\'ve wanted to drop the pretense that we have a\\nrelationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful\\nrelationship, by talking honestly with him, but I\\'ve always thought, \"Why\\nbe dramatic? And you know he\\'ll only get evasive and then find some excuse\\nto get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to\\ncome back.\" It\\'s been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on\\nwith the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I\\ncould think of.\\n   Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn\\'t going\\nto pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the\\noutcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and\\nraved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and\\nin which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was\\nbeyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the\\nallowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not\\nquietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their\\nrelationship, she didn\\'t want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung\\nup. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is\\nthe first time she\\'s ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if\\nshe\\'s divorced my brother, and that it\\'s a relief in some ways to have the\\nbreak out in the open and done with.\\n \\n    I have mixed feelings. I\\'m proud of Mom for sticking up for herself;\\nangry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for\\npersisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their\\nchildren; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my\\nbrother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us\\nthat he\\'s willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to\\nappease an unappeasable,\\nemotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess;\\nscared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will\\nchange and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self-\\nrighteous over this bit of proof that they can\\'t \"get away\" with treating\\nus or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even\\nbeginning to gloat over others\\' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad,\\nsad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in\\na horrible, destructive situation that they can\\'t see a way out of--or\\nthey can\\'t bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I\\'m frustrated\\nbecause I don\\'t know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me\\nup the wall.

Med. Nutrition about vitamin C and oxalate production(\\ntoxic, kidney stone formation?).  I decided to post my answer here as well \\nbecause of the recent question about kidney stones.  Not long after I got \\ninto Sci. Med. I got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium \\nwould prevent kidney stone formation.  I\\'m going to state it again here.\\nBut the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take B6 \\nsupplements.  Read on to find out why(I have my asbestos suit on now guys).\\n\\nVitamin C will form oxalic acid.  But large doses are needed (above 6 grams \\nper day).\\n\\n\\t1. Review Article \"Nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney \\n\\t   stones with particular emphasis on Vitamin C\" Int. Clin. Nutr. Rev.\\n\\t   5(3):110-129(1985).\\n\\nBut glycine also forms oxalic acid(D-amino acid oxidases).  For both \\nglycine and vitamin C, one of the best ways to drastically reduce this \\nproduction is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin C or glycine, \\nbut to increase your intake of vitamin B6.\\n\\n\\t2. \"Control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in \\n\\t    patients with kidney stones\" Int. Urol. Nephrol. 20(4):353-59(1988)\\n\\t    200 to 500 mg of B6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary \\n\\t    excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program.\\n\\n\\t3. The action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria\" Clin. Sci. 38\\n\\t   :277-86(1970).  Patients receiving at least 150mg B6 each day \\n\\t   showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels.\\n\\nFor gylcine, this effect is due to increased transaminase activity(B6 is \\nrequired for transaminase activity) which makes less glycine available for \\noxidative deamination(D-amino acid oxidases).  For vitamin C, the effect is \\nquite different.  There are different pathways for vitamin C catabolism.  \\nThe pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40% \\nof the ingested dose going into oxalic acid.  But this is highly variable \\nand the vitamin C review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto \\n6 grams per day, not too much vitamin C gets catabolized to form oxalic \\nacid.  At very high doses of vitamin C(above 10 grams per day), more of the \\nextra vitamin C (more than 40% conversion) can end up as oxalic acid.  In a \\nvery early study on vitamin C and oxalic production(Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. \\nMed. 85:190-92(1954), intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day \\nincreased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg \\nper day.  Until 8 grams per day was reached, the average excreted was \\nincreased by only 3 to 12mg per day(2 gram dose, 4 gram dose, 8 gram dose \\nand 9gram dose). 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion \\nbefore supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average \\nbefore supplementation.\\n\\nB6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body.  There \\nare probably some enzymes that require vitamin B6 that we don\\'t know about \\nyet.  Vitamin C catabolism is still not completely understood but the \\nspeculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must \\nhave an enzyme in it that requires B6.  Differences in B6 levels could then \\nexplain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin C \\nchallenge(this is not the preferred route of catabolism).  Increasing your \\nintake of B6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you \\ntake vitamin C supplements.  Since the typical American diet is deficient \\nin B6, some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium-oxalate \\nkidney stones is B6 deficiency(especially since so little oxalic acid gets \\nabsorbed from the gut).  Diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day \\nshowed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate(Urol Int.35:309\\n-15,1980).  If 400mg was present each day, there was a significant increase \\nin urinary oxalate excretion.\\n\\n\\tHere are the high oxalate foods:\\n\\n\\t1. Beans, coca, instant coffee, parsley, rhubarb, spinach and tea.\\n\\t   Contain at least 25mg/100grams\\n\\n\\t2. Beet tops, carrots, celery, chocolate, cumber, grapefruit, kale, \\n\\t   peanuts, pepper, sweet potatoe.\\n\\t   Contain 10 to 25 mg/100grams.\\n\\nIf the threshold is 130mg per day, you can see that you really have a lot \\nof latitude in food selection.  A recent N.Eng.J. Med. article also points \\nout that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your \\nintake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being \\nabsorbed at all.  If you also increase your intake of B6, you shouldn\\'t \\nhave to worry about kidney stones at all. The RDA for B6 is 2mg per day for \\nmales and 1.6mg per day for females(directly related to protein intake).\\nB6 can be toxic(nerve damage) if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more \\nper day for an extended peroid(weeks to months).  \\n\\nThe USDA food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1.87 mg per day \\nfor males and 1.16mg per day for females living in the U.S.  Coupled with \\nthis low intake was a high protein diet(which greatly increases the B6 \\nrequirement), as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that \\neither block B6 absorption, are metabolic antagonists of B6, or promote B6 \\nexcretion in the urine.  Common ones are: birth control pills, alcohol,\\nisoniazid, penicillamine, and corticosteroids.  I tell my students to \\nsupplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that \\nincrease the B6 requirement.  The dose recommended for patients taking \\nbirth control pills is 10-15mg per day and this should work for most of the \\nother drugs that increase the B6 requirement(this would be on top of your \\ndietary intake of B6).  Any patient that has a history of kidney stone \\nformation should be given B6 supplements.\\n\\nOne other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your \\nCa/Mg dietary ratio is 2/1.  Magnesium-oxalate is much more soluble than is \\ncalcium-oxalate.\\n\\n\\t4. \"The magnesium:calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of \\npatients with calcium oxalate calculi\"Invest.

Presse Med. 161(1):25-27(1987).\\n\\nThere are actually about three times as many articles published in the \\nmedical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone \\nformation than there are for B6.  I thought that I was being pretty safe in \\nstating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier \\npost in this news group but good old John A. in Mass. jumped all over me.

In short, many evangelicals claim that they are\\ninfallible on the matter of religious texts.\\n\\nIn particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can\\nthink of epistemology as \"how do you know?\"  That question, it turns out, is\\na very troubling one.\\n\\nThe problem with `absolute certainty\\' is that, at the bottom, at least some of\\nthe thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that\\neverything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to\\ndiscover a source of truth is in question.\\n\\nAnd that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of\\nauthority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional\\nInerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of\\nPapal Infallibility, too.)\\n\\nZeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and\\nseveral other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and\\npossibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute\\nTruth.\\n\\nHe may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct.\\nHis conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made\\nmistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His\\nconclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made\\nmistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made\\nmistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)\\n\\nEverything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that\\nhappened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what\\nhe does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own\\ninfallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own\\nreasoning, that belief cannot be considered \"absolutely certain\".\\n\\nZeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief\\nis only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can\\nsay that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.\\n\\nAny belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on\\nyour own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible\\nthinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy to demonstrate.  Let\\'s go back to our shorthand method of doing\\nepistemology: \"how do you know?\"  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:\\n\\n A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.\\n\\n B: How do you know?\\n\\n A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church\\n    teachings and came to this conclusion.\\n\\n B: How do you know you studied history correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I double-checked everything.\\n\\n B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?\\n\\n A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.\\n\\n B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn\\'t mean it is\\n    true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?\\n\\n A: ...\\n\\nAnd, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say \"I\\ncan\\'t prove that there are no mistakes\" -- and as long as you may have made a\\nmistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.\\n\\nThere is no way out of the loop.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the \"arrogance of Christians\" arises: many people believe\\nthat their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the\\ndoctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are\\ninfallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.\\n\\nClaiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led\\nyou to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.\\n\\n *\\n\\nPeople who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to\\nfind _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.

It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only\\nat that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the\\nwhole design should be changed to support 24bit images.\\nThat were not done and now we have\\n -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)\\n -the program has human interface errors.\\n\\nOtherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without\\nclearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.\\n\\n[ ..deleted.. ]\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nSome new items follows.\\n\\n==clip==\\n\\nI have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24\\noption than with default option we have.\\nThe reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)\\nthe same than used in ppmquant.\\n\\nIf you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found\\nthat rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv\\n(our default) in that order.

I am not saying that I totally agree with his  \\ninterpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He  \\ninterprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good  \\nold U. S. of A.  That\\'s right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways.   \\nThe Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the  \\nWHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese  \\nsuccess of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the  \\nworld.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn\\'t the whole world mourn?

No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I  \\ndon\\'t think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the  \\nmost powerful nation on earth.\\n\\nAgain, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy  \\nof consideration.\\n\\nJeffrey Little\\n',\n",

Such a position is only held by some groups and not the\\nmajority of Pentecostals.

About 10 years ago, my family\\nand I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the\\nstreet, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me...\\nher name in Erin.

So I\\ndrove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent\\nthe whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though\\nwe had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being\\nin person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met.\\n(She\\'s one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could\\nask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to \\nmention WAY out of my league...although I\\'m  not unattractive mind you), but\\nshe had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family\\nis one of those families who goes to church but that is about the\\nextent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people.

I\\'ve pretty much decided on either\\none of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn\\'t it\\nbe fun to actually see each other more than once every few years??\\nWhat do you think abou that?

A convert no less, attracted by the\\nrational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity\\n[in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I\\nnever had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and\\ndo, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to\\nlook down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who\\nhad to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely\\noblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with\\nmiracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the\\nBible as God\\'s sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue\\nthat the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God\\'s\\nrevelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the\\nChurch that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant\\nludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance\\nof Luther\\'s right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked.\\n\\tBut recently I read Peter Brown\\'s _Body and Society_. It is very\\nwell researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting\\nquestions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today\\'s\\ncarzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, \\ntotally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable\\nviews about other human beings. \\n\\tnow the question is this: were the first Christians just as\\nweird, but we\\'ve got used to them, or did the pristine \"Fall of the\\nChurch\" happen within one generation. It certainly did\\'nt have to\\nwait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so,\\nwha does  this say about God\\'s promise to always support the Church.\\nIt\\'s no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church\\nnot being an organization at me. It\\'s a community or it is nothing,\\nand it was the early communities that were weird. The institional\\nchurch was a model of sanity by comparison.\\n\\tI would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to\\nthis entirely serious issue. I\\'m not sure it is an issue for Protestants\\nwith their \"soul alone with Jesus\" approach, but for we who see the\\n\"ecclesia\" as a \"koinoia\" over time and space, the weird early\\nChristians are a problem.\\n\\n[This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants\\nhave a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  \"The soul\\nalone with God\" is certainly important for Protestants, but it\\'s by no\\nmeans the whole story.\\n\\nI have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out,\\nProtestants don\\'t have quite the same problem you do, because we\\nbelieve that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant\\nmythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or\\nmore likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion,\\nstarting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated\\npower during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it\\nearlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept\\nthe theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including\\nsuch items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of\\nReformers such as Luther and Calvin, you\\'ll find Church Fathers such\\nas Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you\\'ll find many\\nProtestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was\\n\"wierd\".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don\\'t\\nmuch want to talk about in this context, since it\\'s been looked at\\nrecently -- that\\'s the question of whether one can really think of\\nAugustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views\\non Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to\\nProtestant thought.)\\n\\nOne thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology.\\nThere are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What\\nconcerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We\\nsee every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there\\'s good\\nreason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than\\nthat.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there\\'s good reason to\\nthink that many Christians were happily married.  I can\\'t help\\nsuspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and\\nsane people that we do now.  I think there\\'s also a certain level of\\n\"revisionism\" active in history at the moment.  I don\\'t mean that\\nthey\\'re manufacturing things out of whole cloth.

Chance would have it that \"my weekend\" with my \\ndaughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.\\n\\nAlthough I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided\\nthat the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith\\nwas too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a\\ndate), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.\\n\\nDuring the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church. \\n\\nWhen our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she \\nbe baptised as Catholic. This wasn\\'t a problem with me.\\n\\nDuring a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease\\nthat affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for\\ntwo months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated \"effectively\".\\n\\nIn other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.\\n\\nDuring the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over\\nmy daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday\\nvisitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study\\nbooks to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.\\n\\nLast fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings.\\nAt that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time,\\nI started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend.\\nI did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a\\nreligious community.\\n\\nToday, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for \\nCommunion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine\\n(The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then\\nballed the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the\\npew in front of us.\\n\\nI feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her\\nreligious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments\\nif you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.\\n\\nMy daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and\\nmature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly\\nfor religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with\\nmy daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.\\n\\nMy initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith\\nin Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I\\nwould never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays\\nwith her again.\\n\\nI do not want to \"drive her from the fold\", and would be willing to allow her\\nto continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only\\nfor two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nIf you have a response, please e-mail me a copy.

Suppose you\\n\\twant to have breaks every 30 minutes, starting from 9 am.\\n\\tPress F7 (Special Time...) to enter an appointment, enter\\n\\t9:30, hit Enter, and type some text in saying what the break\\n\\tis for.  Then press F5 to set an alarm on this entry, and repeat \\n\\tfor the next appointment.\\n\\n\\tBy using Windows Recorder, you can record the keystrokes\\n\\tthat set up breaks throughout a day in a .REC file.  Put this\\n\\tfile on your \\'run=\\' line, as above, and you will then, with\\n\\ta single keypress, be able to set up your daily appointments\\n\\twith RSI exercises.\\n\\n\\tThe above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs. \\n\\tAn example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job\\n\\tthat runs at 9:30 am and warns you to take a break; this will\\n\\tdepend a lot on your operating system.\\n\\n\\tWhile these approaches are not ideal, they are a good way of forcing \\n\\tyourself to take a break if you can\\'t get hold of a suitable RSI \\n\\tmanagement tool.  If you are techie enough you might want to\\n\\twrite a version of Typewatch (see above) for your operating\\n\\tsystem, using batch jobs or whatever fits best.\\n\\n    Tool: Digital watches with count-down timers\\n    Available from:\\n\\tVarious sources, e.g. Casio BP-100.\\n    Description:\\n\\tMany digital watches have timers that count down from a settable\\n\\tnumber of minutes; they usually reset easily to that number, either\\n\\tmanually or automatically.  \\n\\n\\tWhile these are a very basic tool, they are very useful if you\\n\\tare writing, reading, driving, or doing anything away from\\n\\ta computer which can still cause or aggravate RSI.  The great\\n\\tadvantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you\\n\\tare doing.\\n\\t\\n    Comments:\\n\\tMy own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to\\n\\tmy writing a lot more, and still reading as much as ever, which\\n\\tactually aggravated the RSI in my right arm though the left\\n\\tarm improved.  Getting a count-down timer watch has been\\n\\tvery useful on some occasions where I write a lot in a day.\\n\\n\\tI have tried an old fashioned hour-glass type egg timer, but\\n\\tthese are not much good because they do not give an audible\\n\\twarning of the end of the time period!\\n\\n\\nKEYBOARD REMAPPING TOOLS: these enable you to change your keyboard mapping\\nso you can type one-handedly or with a different two-handed layout.  \\nOne-handed typing tools may help, but be VERY careful about how \\nyou use them -- if you keep the same overall typing workload you\\nare simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing,\\nand may therefore make matters worse.\\n\\n    Tool: hsh (public domain)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/hsh.shar\\n    Platforms: UNIX (don\\'t know which ones)\\n    Description:\\n\\tAllows one-handed typing and other general keyboard remappings.\\n\\tOnly works through tty\\'s (so, you can use it with a terminal or\\n\\tan xterm, but not most X programs).\\n\\n    Tool: Dvorak keyboard tools (various)\\n    Available from:\\n\\tAnonymous ftp: soda.berkeley.edu:pub/typing-injury/xdvorak.c\\n\\tAlso built into Windows 3.x. \\n    Description:\\n\\tThe Dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout\\n\\tthat involves more balanced hand use.

It is extremely important to test whether theories can\\n_predict_ something new or not yet observed.

If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but\\nactually no existing being could give an answer. \\n\\nImagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also\\nask: \"Why nothing exists?\" This is equivalent to my counter-question,\\n\"why nothing exists in nothingness\". \\n\\nNow, \"why anything exists\" is equivalent to \"why something exists in\\nsomethingness\".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies\\nfor the poor wording in my previous post.\\n\\n> I might add, the worldview of \"Things that exist do, and things that\\n> don\\'t...don\\'t\" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable,\\n> as does the theist\\'s belief in God.

However, the question \\n\"why do I exist, in particular\" is _not_ an invalid question - this\\nis not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to\\ntell, and I can\\'t just believe in any given explanation instead of\\nanother, especially since I found I was deluding myself. \\n\\n> My apologies.  I was using why as \"why did this come to be\".  Why did\\n> pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.\\n\\nI think \"pre-existence\" is an oxymoron.

He does not say, \"well, alright,\\nyou can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your\\nplans.\"  He said \"Follow me.\"  His message is NOT \"I\\'m just a sweety-pie\\nwho would never hurt a fly, you\\'ve got all the time in the world, and\\nDivine Judgement, that\\'s only a fairy tale.\"  \"Our great God and Savior\"\\nJesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the\\nworld.

Perhaps they were \"strong in\\nthe faith?\"\\n\\n---------------------------\\n\\n[No, I don\\'t believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was\\nwriting for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews\\nat the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There\\nare rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic\\nlaws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to\\nface after Jesus\\' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to\\nfollow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn\\'t say\\nthat the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it\\ndidn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5.\\nAs far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did\\ncontinue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they\\ncontinued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile\\nChristians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the\\nceremonial aspects of it).\\n\\nJesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that\\nMat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with\\nGentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a\\ncouple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke\\n7) suggest that he was a \"God-fearer\", i.e. a Gentile who followed\\nGod, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by\\nJewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such.\\nThis seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view\\nthat Gentiles need not accept the Law.\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on\\nthe Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we\\nhave to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent rejection of the Law, and\\nhow that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of the Law.  At least as I\\nread Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a\\ncertain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn\\'t one of the\\nabolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes\\nthat he might be understood this way, and assures us that that\\'s not\\nwhat he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being\\npresent to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an\\nimpossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ.\\nPaul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s clearest here, and not everyone\\nagrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that\\neven this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law.\\nIt still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota\\nor dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s\\nimportant that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not\\nthe end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.\\n\\nIt\\'s unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but\\nwe should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the\\nway terms like \"family values\" take on special meaning from the\\ncurrent context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to\\nfigure out why \"family values\" should be used as a code word for\\nopposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I\\nthink Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was\\ninvolved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values\\nthat go along with the term \"Law\", any more than people who concerned\\nabout the \"family values\" movement are really opposed to family\\nvalues.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I am not\\nat all sure this is the best path to follow.\\n\\tWhile the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the \\nrevelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this\\nrevalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one\\ndenommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian\\ncongregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just\\nreading the Bible.\\n\\tThis does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although\\nI would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the\\nBook of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are\\ncomfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to\\nread the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable\\nlack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really\\nsturdy, somewhere in Chronicles.\\n\\tThe point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith\\nof Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital\\nbeliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned -\\nthe Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church\\norganization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the\\nlived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one\\nhopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies\\nin the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading.\\n\\tFollowing up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I \\nwould even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the\\nchristian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing\\nthe nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into\\nthe christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading\\nGraham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard\\nManley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene\\'s _Monsignor\\nQuixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian,\\nbut such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly,\\nI often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after\\nreading many parts of the Bible.

The sermon was\\nbased on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out\\nspies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember,\\nbecause of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that\\nthe Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were\\n\"melting in fear.\"  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and\\nknowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt\\nuncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On\\nthe other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values\\nheld by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in\\nout-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual\\nwarfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.\\n\\nThe next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites\\ntake Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except\\nfor Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about\\nBosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that\\nthe massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.

Now the\\nproto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and \"the\\nwoman\", and enmity between Satan and \"her seed.\"  Now the woman is both\\nEve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. \\n\"Her seed\" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the\\nsame way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as\\nwe do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that\\nMary is also sinless because if she wasn\\'t she would 1) not be at enmity\\nwith the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her\\nsinlessness to Christ\\'s sinlessness would be called into question, as\\nwould God\\'s veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the\\nserpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved.\\n    Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the\\nArchangle Gabriel \"full of grace.\"  As I pointed out above this is from\\nthe Greek word \"Kecharitomene\" which means not just full of grace, but a\\nplenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by\\nthe footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, \"Hail you who have been and reamin\\nfilled with grace.\"  But that is a little to long to say, so it is\\nreduced to full of grace.  And as it says, \"you who have been\" Mary had\\nalways been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which\\nwas also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later.\\n    It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done\\nwhat the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if\\nGod could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his\\nMother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the\\nFathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo\\n, St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of\\nChristian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on\\nthe matter in \"Ineffibilus Deus.\"\\n\\nAndy Byler\\n',\n",

I\\'m not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That\\nconclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved.\\nAnd perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let\\'s say) we now know.  That doesn\\'t\\nmean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn\\'t see it as\\nbeing necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of\\nan action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed\\nnecessary enough to go ahead with it.\\n\\nBut don\\'t assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I\\ndon\\'t!

Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing\\nwasn\\'t accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a\\ndecisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War,\\nprecision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big\\nstink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted\\n*in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians\\n(proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing\\nin WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some\\ncivilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than\\nany other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives\\nwith minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories\\nof \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk.\\nYes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years\\nand the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But \\nwe are expected to swallow that \"hundreds of thousands\" of \\n*civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with \\nthe Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that!  \\nWhat hogwash.  If \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi civilians died, \\nit was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to \\nthe Allied bombing.\\n\\nRegards,\\n\\nJim B.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'From: alastair@farli.otago.ac.nz (Alastair Thomson)\\nSubject: Does \\'Just/justifiable War\\' exist?\\nOrganization: University of Otago\\nLines: 107\\n\\nHi there netters,\\nI have a question I would very much like to see some discussion on:\\nIs there such a thing as a \\'justifible\\' war? \\n\\nWhat I would love to see it some basis from scripture for either: \"All war  \\nis wrong\", or \"Some war is justifiable\". \\n\\nTo get things started I would like to outline why I am asking the  \\nquestion. In my high school days I had been quite involved in the the New  \\nZealand Cadet Forces (This is a bit like ROTC from what I understand of  \\nit, but with a lot more emphasis on fun than military career training).  \\nThrough this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved  \\nin the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation  \\nhardware as the very best a \\'real\\' flyer could ask for. My favourite  \\ncomputer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both  \\npast and present. \\n\\nI became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all  \\nmilitary activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition  \\nto God\\'s commandments to love one another, especially one\\'s enemies.\\n\\nDuring the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to  \\nthe reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation  \\ntechnology I so admire - The F117A \\'Stealh\\' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16  \\nstrike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy  \\nsimulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam\\'s  \\nbio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his  \\nMig\\'s in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful  \\ngame. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way.  \\nOne only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact  \\nof war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a  \\npilot is simply a \\'target\\'. Dead civilians are \\'collateral damage\\'. These  \\neuphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose  \\nsupport are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to  \\nlook at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.\\n\\nNow we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and  \\nthe prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in  \\nthe former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of  \\nSarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry \\'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa,  \\nhas caused me to rethink where I stand on \\'justifiable\\' war.\\n\\nI will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say  \\n- Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut  \\nreactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality  \\nhistory brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for  \\nmy reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I  \\nam working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.\\n\\n1. The Second World War\\n\\t- Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped.\\n\\t- Massive civilian casualties on both sides \\n\\t\\t- Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n2. Korean war\\n\\t- Political expansionism by North Korea, basically\\n\\t  communism vs. capitalism.\\n\\t- Probably not justifiable.\\n\\n3. Vietnam\\n\\t- As above, worsened by US involvement.\\n\\n4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia.\\n\\t- Genocide by Khmer Rouge.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable.\\n\\n5. Iraq (Desert Storm)\\n\\t- Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply\\n\\t- Other factors such as genocide.\\n\\t- Not sure, but probably justifiable\\n\\n6. A future involvement in Bosnia\\n\\t- Genocide - so called \\'Ethnic Cleansing\\'\\n\\t- Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties.\\n\\t- Probably justifiable\\n\\n7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic,  \\nsomewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya  \\nor Israel.\\n\\t- My feelings in this are simple\\n\\t- Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent\\n\\t- I love the New Zealand government\\'s stand on banning all nuclear\\n\\t  armed or powered warships from NZ port.\\n\\t- Never justifiable.\\n\\nThese are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused.

UK.\\nSupersedes: <19930308134439@mantis.co.uk>\\nLines: 646\\n\\nArchive-name: atheism/introduction\\nAlt-atheism-archive-name: introduction\\nLast-modified: 5 April 1993\\nVersion: 1.2\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\n                          An Introduction to Atheism\\n                       by mathew <mathew@mantis.co.uk>\\n\\nThis article attempts to provide a general introduction to atheism.  Whilst I\\nhave tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you\\nshould always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some\\nrelevant books are listed in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article\\nas an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped\\nup repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other\\nfrequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions\\nposed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect\\nquestions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians\\nwho proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as\\nChristianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbeing.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What is atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is\\noften referred to as the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter as \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt is important to note the difference between these two positions.  \"Weak\\natheism\" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are \"strong atheists\".\\n\\nSome atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their\\natheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making\\nflat-out denials.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to\\nbelieving that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or\\nnot.  Which brings us to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What is agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who\\ndisclaimed (\"strong\") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things\\nmust be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exists.\\n\\nWords are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that\\nyou can work out someone\\'s philosophical point of view simply from the fact\\nthat she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" only when\\nreferring to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" has so many shades of meaning, it\\nis very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for\\nsure is that atheists don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person chooses to be an atheist, it\\'s best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions\\nis essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exists.\\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?\"\\n\\nThere are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is\\nquite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects\\nobeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly\\nwell-defined is a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably\\nimpossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to\\nshow that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in\\nquestion is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing\\nmight be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search is\\noften impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest\\nprimes, because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist\\nunless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorns, even though they can\\'t conclusively\\nprove that no unicorns exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be\\ntested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by\\ndefault that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God\\nexists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover\\nvarieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious\\nbook does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described\\nby any present-day religion exists.\\n\\nIn practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very\\nclose to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different\\nthat counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of\\nGod are not really applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God is essentially non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoes not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue\\nthat if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no\\nimportance whether he exists or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites.\\nSurely he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically\\nverifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some\\neffect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other things that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\'s a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religious belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:\\n\\nPerson A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the\\nstatement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He\\nthen records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to\\nit, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an \"agreed fact\", but\\nuses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of this digression is that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religious belief?\" depends crucially upon what is meant by\\n\"religious\".  \"Religion\" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman\\ncontrolling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\'s worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" according to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it\\ncategorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of\\n\"religious\" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of\\nhuman behaviour suddenly becoming classed as \"religious\" as well -- such as\\nscience, politics, and watching TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\'s not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is\\n still just an act of faith, like religion is?\"\\n\\nFirstly, it\\'s not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one\\nactually believes in.\\n\\nSecondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists\\ntry to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestioning if experience throws them into doubt.\\n\\nScience has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally\\nassumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are\\nthe sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called\\n\"acts of faith\", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on\\nacts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.\\n\\nFaith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something.\\nAccording to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as\\nreligious followers when claiming that something is \"certain\".  This is not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exists.\\n\\nFaith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certainly doesn\\'t fit that definition, as sceptical atheism\\nhas no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn\\'t really match, as\\neven the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism is not religious, surely it\\'s anti-religious?\"\\n\\nIt is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth is not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religious believers\\nspeak of atheists being \"anti-religious\" they usually mean that the atheists\\nhave some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.\\n\\nThis categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheists take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unless questioned, they\\nwill not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of\\ncourse, this may be in part because atheism is not \"socially acceptable\" in\\nmany countries.\\n\\nA few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to \"convert\" others\\nwhen possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.\\n\\n(To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to\\nworship as they wished.  The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see\\nreligion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the running of the state,\\n surely that\\'s the same as state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall\\nnot legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it\\nmeans not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For\\nexample, religious believers have historically been responsible for\\nencouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations\\ncampaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as\\nreligious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters,\\nand so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists\\nare quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in schools? If there\\'s no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things\\nthat those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they\\nneed not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means\\nthat it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable\\nto care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other\\nmotives.\\n\\n\"You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about\\n atheists?  Why aren\\'t there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don\\'t\\n atheists object to the religious charities?\"\\n\\nThere are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work\\nfor charities founded on a theistic basis.\\n\\nMost atheists seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shouting about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday\\nmatter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it\\'s somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religious beliefs.\\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheists, building a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" is a\\nrather strange idea; it\\'s rather like holding a party to say \"Today is not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against\\n one\\'s upbringing, a way of rebelling?\"\\n\\nPerhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to\\nforce any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselves atheists.\\n\\nIt\\'s also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the\\nexpectations of others.\\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independently.\\n\\n\"How do atheists differ from religious people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\'s all there is to it.\\n\\nAtheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts,\\nthey may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many\\nBuddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without\\nrealising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheists less moral than religious people?\"\\n\\nThat depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course\\natheists are less moral as they don\\'t obey any God.  But usually when one\\ntalks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHumans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheists from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, purely for the purposes\\nof self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheists behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simply because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care\\nwhat happens to others?  They don\\'t know, they simply are that way.\\n\\nNaturally, there are some people who behave \"immorally\" and try to use\\natheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who\\nbehave \"immorally\" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their\\nactions.  For example:\\n\\n  \"Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was\\n   shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited\\n   patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a\\nreligious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorated after \"born again\" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents\\n   said they had driven intoxicated before being \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"Is there such a thing as atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?\", then the\\nanswer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality\\nwhich are at least as strong as those held by religious people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\nis no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same \"moral rules\" as theists,\\nbut for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by\\nhumans, according to the way humans feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.\\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheists just theists who are denying God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible\\nwith what they observed around them.\\n\\nAtheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.\\n\\nThis decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\'s personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only\\nchoice that person can honestly make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheists want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of\\nsuch an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to\\nbelieve something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwilling in their souls to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained\\nabove, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God\\nexists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that\\nall atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded.\\nComments such as \"Of course God is there, you just aren\\'t looking properly\"\\nare likely to be viewed as patronizing.\\n\\nCertainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is\\nvital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbeing sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not\\nwilling to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is\\nfutile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives\\nmeaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives\\ncount, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.\\n\\nIt is a natural human tendency to look for \"meaning\" or \"purpose\" in random\\nevents.  However, it is by no means obvious that \"life\" is the sort of thing\\nthat has a \"meaning\".\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually\\na sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking \"What is the\\nmeaning of life?\" is as silly as asking \"What is the meaning of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.\\n\\n\"So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets.\\nOr on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\'s a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are\\nunable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because\\nit makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that\\'s just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer is \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many\\narguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousands of years of religious belief haven\\'t resulted in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely\\nto be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theists question their beliefs? Don\\'t the same arguments\\n apply?\"\\n\\nNo, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is\\nthe sceptical \"default position\" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism\\nis a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs\\nbecause of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers,\\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\'s not\\njust a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings;\\nthink of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances\\nof ill people being \"healed\" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines\\nprescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died\\nbecause they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.\\n\\nIt is arguable that the Catholic Church\\'s opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.\\n\\nReligious believers have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it\\'s hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all\\nconvinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who\\'s a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churches like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselves?\\n\\nIn the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncalls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his\\nactions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians\\nare just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if\\nthe Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs\\naren\\'t a perversion of what your God intended?\\n\\nIf there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered\\nothers because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since\\n nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely\\n that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue,\\npositive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much\\nharder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns\\ndon\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlikely that they are myths.\\n\\nIt is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheists\\nwould argue that asserting nothing is better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\'s so great, why are there so many theists?\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit is, or whether it \"works\"; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-sciences.\\n\\nMany atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in\\ngods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\'s more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world,\\nwe find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started\\nas a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other\\npurposes as well.\\n\\n\"But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say\\n something?\"\\n\\nNot really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it\\'s\\nworth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it\\'s\\nrather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded\\n that God exists?\"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who\\ndoes not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is\\nnot determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to\\nrealize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the\\nsame way that theists view their religious leaders.\\n\\nA famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but\\nwhen she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on\\nsubjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates\\n nothing?\"\\n\\nNot entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has\\nproperties which have helped it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetics talks of \"memes\" -- sets of ideas which can propagate\\nthemselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view\\nreligions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by\\nencouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by\\ndiscouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some\\nreligious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by\\nother memes.\\n\\nOf course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with\\nsuccessful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of\\nthe number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing\\nbecause of the number of people who have caught it.\\n\\n\"Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important\\n messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a\\nfew of them; don\\'t be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some\\nreligions.\\n\\n   There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.\\n\\n   Be especially sceptical of positive claims.\\n\\n   If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it\\'s up to you to\\n   find it.\\n\\n   Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.\\n\\n   Make the most of your life, as it\\'s probably the only one you\\'ll have.\\n\\n   It\\'s no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change\\n   yourself.\\n\\n   Just because something\\'s popular doesn\\'t mean it\\'s good.\\n\\n   If you must assume something, assume something it\\'s easy to test.\\n\\n   Don\\'t believe things just because you want them to be true.\\n\\nand finally (and most importantly):\\n\\n   All beliefs should be open to question.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read this article.\\n\\n\\nmathew\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.2\\n\\niQCVAgUBK8AjRXzXN+VrOblFAQFSbwP+MHePY4g7ge8Mo5wpsivX+kHYYxMErFAO\\n7ltVtMVTu66Nz6sBbPw9QkbjArbY/S2sZ9NF5htdii0R6SsEyPl0R6/9bV9okE/q\\nnihqnzXE8pGvLt7tlez4EoeHZjXLEFrdEyPVayT54yQqGb4HARbOEHDcrTe2atmP\\nq0Z4hSSPpAU=\\n=q2V5\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nFor information about PGP 2.2, send mail to pgpinfo@mantis.co.uk.\\nÿ\\n',\n",
